{"id": 6871, "question": "John raises emu.  He has 4 pens for emu and each pen has 6 emus in it.  Each female emu lays 1 egg per day.  If half the emu are females how many eggs does he get a week?", "solution": "There are 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 emus\nSo there are 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 female emus\nSo he gets 12*7=<<12*7=84>>84 eggs a week\n#### 84", "clean_solution": "There are 6*4=24 emus\nSo there are 24/2=12 female emus\nSo he gets 12*7=84 eggs a week", "perturbed_solution": "There are 6*4=24 emus\nSo there are 24/2=12 female emus\nSo he gets 12*7=9 eggs a week", "answer": 84.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 84", "answer_solution_clean": "84", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution contains an error in the calculation of the number of eggs. Each female emu lays 1 egg per day, so in a week (7 days), each female emu will lay 7 eggs.\n\nCalculating the total number of eggs laid by the female emus in a week:\n\n12 female emus * 7 eggs per week = 84 eggs\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 84", "answer_solution_perturbed": "84"}
