Let's correct it:\n\nKim got 2 candy bars a week for 16 weeks, so she got:\n2 * 16 = 32 candy bars.\n\nShe would eat 1 candy bar every 4 weeks, so in 16 weeks she only ate:\n16 / 4 = 4 candy bars.\n\nNow, to find out how many candy bars she has saved:\nShe saved 32 candy bars and only ate 4, so she still has:\n32 - 4 = 28 candy bars.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 28", "answer_solution_perturbed": "28"}
