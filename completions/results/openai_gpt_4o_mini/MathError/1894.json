{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog-walking.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 71 hours spent dog-walking.", "answer": 24.0, "perturbed_answer": 71.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many hours she has left after accounting for the hours spent on Monday and Wednesday.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we know that Charlotte has spent a total of 24 hours walking dogs from Monday and Wednesday. Since she has a total of 32 hours available for dog-walking this week, we can calculate the remaining hours for Tuesday:\n\nRemaining hours = Total hours - Hours spent\nRemaining hours = 32 hours - 24 hours = 8 hours\n\nOn Tuesday, Charlotte walks 2 Chihuahuas, which takes her 2 hours (as calculated in the partial solution). Therefore, the time left for walking poodles on Tuesday is:\n\nTime left for poodles = Remaining hours - Time spent on Chihuahuas\nTime left for poodles = 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours\n\nSince it takes 2 hours to walk each poodle, we can find out how many poodles she can walk in the remaining 6 hours:\n\nNumber of poodles = Time left for poodles / Time per poodle\nNumber of poodles = 6 hours / 2 hours per poodle = 3 poodles\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 3", "answer_solution_clean": "3", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's correct the total hours spent dog-walking based on the provided information.\n\n1. **Monday:**\n   - Poodles: 4 * 2 hours = 8 hours\n   - Chihuahuas: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours\n   - Total for Monday = 8 + 2 = 10 hours\n\n2. **Tuesday:**\n   - Chihuahuas: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours\n   - Let the number of poodles walked on Tuesday be \\( x \\).
