{"id": 6032, "question": "Nadine went to a garage sale and spent $56. She bought a table for $34 and 2 chairs. Each chair cost the same amount. How much did one chair cost?", "solution": "Nadine spent $56 - $34 for the table = $<<56-34=22>>22 on chairs.\nThe cost of the chairs was equal, so one chair cost $22 / 2 = $<<22/2=11>>11.\n#### 11", "clean_solution": "Nadine spent $56 - $34 for the table = $22 on chairs.", "perturbed_solution": "Nadine spent $56 - $34 for the table = $6 on chairs.", "answer": 22.0, "perturbed_answer": 6.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the cost of one chair, we need to divide the remaining amount Nadine spent on chairs by the number of chairs she bought.\n\nNadine has $22 left for the 2 chairs. \n\nCost of one chair = Total amount spent on chairs / Number of chairs\nCost of one chair = $22 / 2 = $11\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 11", "answer_solution_clean": "11", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the cost of one chair, we need to determine how much she spent on the two chairs. \n\nFrom the partial solution, we know that Nadine spent $6 on the chairs.
