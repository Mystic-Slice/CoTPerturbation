{"id": 1034, "question": "When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?", "solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 cups of cream cheese.\nShe uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\nFor each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eggs.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.", "perturbed_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 10 times her ratio.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 10.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many eggs Betty used, we first need to determine how much cream cheese she used based on the sugar she added.\n\nBetty's ratio of sugar to cream cheese is 1 part sugar to 4 parts cream cheese. Since she used 2 cups of sugar, we can calculate the amount of cream cheese:\n\nCream cheese = 2 cups sugar * 4 = 8 cups cream cheese.\n\nNext, we find out how many teaspoons of vanilla she used. The ratio is 1 teaspoon of vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese. Since she used 8 cups of cream cheese, we calculate the amount of vanilla:\n\nVanilla = 8 cups cream cheese / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\n\nNow, for every teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs.
