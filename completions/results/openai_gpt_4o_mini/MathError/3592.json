{"id": 3592, "question": "Tom goes to a combined undergrad and Ph.D. program.  It takes 3 years to finish the BS and 5 years to finish the Ph.D.  Tom finishes it in 3/4ths the time.  How long does it take for him to finish?", "solution": "The program normally takes 3+5=<<3+5=8>>8 years\nSo he manages to finish in 8*3/4=<<8*3/4=6>>6 years\n#### 6", "clean_solution": "The program normally takes 3+5=8 years\nSo he manages to finish in 8*3/4=6 years", "perturbed_solution": "The program normally takes 3+5=8 years\nSo he manages to finish in 8*3/4=8 years", "answer": 6.0, "perturbed_answer": 8.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 6", "answer_solution_clean": "6", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution states that the program normally takes 8 years. However, the calculation for how long it takes Tom to finish is incorrect. \n\nTo find out how long it takes Tom to finish, we need to calculate:\n\n8 years * (3/4) = 6 years.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 6", "answer_solution_perturbed": "6"}
