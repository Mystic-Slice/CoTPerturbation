{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $2 more when not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $7 more when not on sale.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The final answer is incorrect based on the calculations provided. Let's correct it.\n\nWe have already established that:\n\n- The price of a pint of strawberries on sale is $4.\n- The total revenue without the sale would be $324.\n\nNow, we calculate the price of a pint of strawberries without the sale:\n\nPrice without sale = Total revenue without sale / Number of pints\nPrice without sale = 324 / 54 = $6.\n\nNow, we find the difference in price:\n\nDifference = Price without sale - Price on sale\nDifference = 6 - 4 = $2.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
