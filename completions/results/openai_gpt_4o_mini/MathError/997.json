{"id": 997, "question": "Ittymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?", "solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.\nIf they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=12 fish.", "perturbed_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=89 fish.", "answer": 12.0, "perturbed_answer": 89.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "Since Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day, and they split the fish equally, we need to determine how many fish each person will get.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we found that the total number of fish caught is 12. Since there are three members in the family (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck), we divide the total number of fish by 3:\n\n12 fish / 3 = 4 fish per person.\n\nThus, each of them will be given 4 fish to eat.\n\nFinal answer: #### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many fish Ittymangnark catches, we need to calculate the total number of fish based on the number of eyes Oomyapeck eats.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we have:\n\n1.

Since each fish has 2 eyes, the total number of fish is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal fish = Total eyes / Eyes per fish = 24 / 2 = 12 fish.\n\nNow, since they split the fish equally among the three of them (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck), we divide the total number of fish by 3:\n\nFish per person = Total fish / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4 fish.\n\nThus, each of them will be given 4 fish to eat.\n\nFinal answer: #### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
