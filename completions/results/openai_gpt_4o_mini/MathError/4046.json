{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = 55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = 27 hours on math tutoring for the first two months", "answer": 55.0, "perturbed_answer": 27.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total hours Sam spent on tutoring for the two months, we need to calculate the total earnings and then divide by his hourly rate.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we have:\n\n1. Total earnings for the first month: $200\n2. Total earnings for the second month: $350\n3. Total earnings for both months: $200 + $350 = $550\n\nNow, we divide the total earnings by the hourly rate:\n\nTotal hours = Total earnings / Hourly rate = $550 / $10 = 55 hours\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_perturbed": "55"}
