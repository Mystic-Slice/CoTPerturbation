{"id": 1022, "question": "Rachel is 4 years older than Leah. If the sum of their ages is 34, how old is Rachel?", "solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = <<34-4=30>>30.\nSo Leah would be 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 years old.\nHence, Rachel is 15 + 4 = <<15+4=19>>19 years old.\n#### 19", "clean_solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 30.", "perturbed_solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 68.", "answer": 30.0, "perturbed_answer": 68.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "Let Leah's age be \\( x \\). Then Rachel's age would be \\( x + 4 \\). \n\nThe equation for the sum of their ages is:\n\\[\nx + (x + 4) = 34\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\n2x + 4 = 34\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides:\n\\[\n2x = 30\n\\]\n\nDividing by 2:\n\\[\nx = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, Leah is 15 years old. Therefore, Rachel's age is:\n\\[\nx + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19\n\\]\n\nThus, Rachel is 19 years old. \n\nFinal answer: #### 19", "answer_solution_clean": "19", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's denote Leah's age as L. Since Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, we can express Rachel's age as R = L + 4.\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of their ages is 34:\nL + R = 34.\n\nSubstituting R in the equation:\nL + (L + 4) = 34,\n2L + 4 = 34.\n\nNow, we can solve for L:\n2L = 34 - 4,\n2L = 30,\nL = 15.\n\nNow that we have Leah's age, we can find Rachel's age:\nR = L + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19.\n\nThus, Rachel is 19 years old.\n\nFinal answer: #### 19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "19"}
