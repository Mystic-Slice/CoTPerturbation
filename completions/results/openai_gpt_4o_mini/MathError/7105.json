Richmond has 3000 people.\n2. Richmond has 1000 more people than Victoria, so:\n   Victoria = Richmond - 1000 = 3000 - 1000 = 2000 people.\n3. Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon, so:\n   Let the number of people in Beacon be B.\n   Therefore, Victoria = 4B.\n   We already found that Victoria has 2000 people, so:\n   4B = 2000.\n4. To find B, we divide both sides by 4:\n   B = 2000 / 4 = 500.\n\nThus, the number of people in Beacon is 500.\n\nFinal answer: #### 500", "answer_solution_perturbed": "500"}
