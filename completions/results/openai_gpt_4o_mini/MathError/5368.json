{"id": 5368, "question": "Lisa is making a pizza. She uses 30 pieces of pepperoni for a pizza, twice as many pieces of ham, and 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni. If there are 6 slices of pizza, and everything was distributed evenly, how many pieces of meat altogether are on each slice?", "solution": "There are 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 pieces of ham put on the pizza.\nThere are 30+12 = <<30+12=42>>42 pieces of sausage put on the pizza.\nThere are 30/6 = <<30/6=5>>5 pieces of pepperoni on each pizza slice.\nThere are 60/6 = <<60/6=10>>10 pieces of ham on each pizza slice.\nThere are 42/6 = <<42/6=7>>7 pieces of sausage on each pizza slice.\nThere are 5+10+7 = <<5+10+7=22>>22 pieces altogether on each slice of pizza.\n#### 22", "clean_solution": "There are 30*2 = 60 pieces of ham put on the pizza.\nThere are 30+12 = 42 pieces of sausage put on the pizza.\nThere are 30/6 = 5 pieces of pepperoni on each pizza slice.\nThere are 60/6 = 10 pieces of ham on each pizza slice.\nThere are 42/6 = 7 pieces of sausage on each pizza slice.\nThere are 5+10+7 = 22 pieces altogether on each slice of pizza.", "perturbed_solution": "There are 30*2 = 60 pieces of ham put on the pizza.\nThere are 30+12 = 42 pieces of sausage put on the pizza.\nThere are 30/6 = 5 pieces of pepperoni on each pizza slice.\nThere are 60/6 = 10 pieces of ham on each pizza slice.\nThere are 42/6 = 7 pieces of sausage on each pizza slice.\nThere are 5+10+7 = 72 pieces altogether on each slice of pizza.", "answer": 22.0, "perturbed_answer": 72.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 22", "answer_solution_clean": "22", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of pieces of meat on each slice of pizza, we need to sum the pieces of pepperoni, ham, and sausage per slice.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Pieces of pepperoni on each slice: 5\n- Pieces of ham on each slice: 10\n- Pieces of sausage on each slice: 7\n\nNow, we add these together:\n5 (pepperoni) + 10 (ham) + 7 (sausage) = 22 pieces of meat on each slice.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 22", "answer_solution_perturbed": "22"}
