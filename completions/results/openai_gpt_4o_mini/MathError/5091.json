Let's correct it:\n\n1. He needs 3 cans of frosting for the layer cakes.\n2. He needs 18 cans of frosting for the cupcakes, single cakes, and brownies.\n\nNow, we add these two amounts together:\n\n3 cans (for layer cakes) + 18 cans (for cupcakes, single cakes, and brownies) = 21 cans of frosting.\n\nThus, the total number of cans of frosting he needs is 21.\n\nFinal answer: #### 21", "answer_solution_perturbed": "21"}
