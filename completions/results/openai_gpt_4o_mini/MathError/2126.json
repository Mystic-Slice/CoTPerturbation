{"id": 2126, "question": "Adam teaches 50 students a year. How many students will Adam teach in 10 years if in the first year he only teaches 40 students?", "solution": "Adam will teach 50 * 9 = <<50*9=450>>450 students in 9 years.\nSo, in 10 year Adam will teach 450 + 40 = <<450+40=490>>490 students.\n#### 490", "clean_solution": "Adam will teach 50 * 9 = 450 students in 9 years.\nSo, in 10 year Adam will teach 450 + 40 = 490 students.", "perturbed_solution": "Adam will teach 50 * 9 = 450 students in 9 years.\nSo, in 10 year Adam will teach 450 + 40 = 406 students.", "answer": 490.0, "perturbed_answer": 406.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 490", "answer_solution_clean": "490", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution contains a mistake in the final calculation. The correct calculation should be:\n\nAdam will teach 50 * 9 = 450 students in 9 years. \nIn the first year, he teaches 40 students. \n\nSo, in 10 years, Adam will teach 450 + 40 = 490 students.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 490", "answer_solution_perturbed": "490"}
