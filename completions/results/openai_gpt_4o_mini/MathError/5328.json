{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before.

Mona joined 9 groups, and each group has 4 players (including herself), so she played with a total of 9 * 4 = 36 player slots.\n2. However, we need to consider the overlaps:\n   - In one group, she grouped with 2 players she had grouped with before.\n   - In another group, she grouped with 1 player she had grouped with before.\n\nLet's denote:\n- The total number of unique players Mona grouped with as \\( U \\).\n- The 2 players she grouped with before as \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\).\n- The 1 player she grouped with before as \\( P_3 \\).\n\nNow, if we assume that the 2 players \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\) are different from \\( P_3 \\), we can calculate the unique players as follows:\n\n- Total players from the groups = 36\n- Overlapping players = 2 (from the first group) + 1 (from the second group) = 3\n- Since \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\) are counted twice, we need to subtract them from the total.\n\nThus, the unique players can be calculated as:\n\\[ U = 36 - 3 = 33 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: #### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
