{"id": 6558, "question": "It takes 20 minutes for John to go to the bathroom 8 times.  How long would it take to go 6 times?", "solution": "He spends 20/8=<<20/8=2.5>>2.5 minutes each time he goes in\nSo it would take 2.5*6=<<2.5*6=15>>15 minutes to go 6 times\n#### 15", "clean_solution": "He spends 20/8=2.5 minutes each time he goes in\nSo it would take 2.5*6=15 minutes to go 6 times", "perturbed_solution": "He spends 20/8=2.5 minutes each time he goes in\nSo it would take 2.5*6=75 minutes to go 6 times", "answer": 15.0, "perturbed_answer": 75.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 15", "answer_solution_clean": "15", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The calculation in the partial solution is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:\n\nHe spends 20/8 = 2.5 minutes each time he goes in. \n\nTo find out how long it would take to go 6 times, we multiply the time per visit by the number of visits:\n\n2.5 minutes * 6 = 15 minutes.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 15", "answer_solution_perturbed": "15"}
