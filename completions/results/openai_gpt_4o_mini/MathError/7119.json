{"id": 7119, "question": "Jerry was asked by her mom to do grocery shopping. He needs to buy 2 liters of mustard oil that costs $13 per liter, 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta that costs $4 per pound, and 1  pound of pasta sauce that costs $5. If Jerry can keep the rest of the $50 after grocery shopping, how much money will he have?", "solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $<<13*2=26>>26.\nThe cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nSo, Jerry spent a total of $26 + $12 + $5 = $<<26+12+5=43>>43 for grocery shopping.\nThus, Jerry will have $50 - $43 = $<<50-43=7>>7 for himself.\n#### 7", "clean_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $26.", "perturbed_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $98.", "answer": 26.0, "perturbed_answer": 98.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "Continuing from the partial solution:\n\nThe cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $12.\n\nThe cost of 1 pound of pasta sauce is $5 x 1 = $5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost of all the items:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of mustard oil + Cost of penne pasta + Cost of pasta sauce\nTotal cost = $26 + $12 + $5 = $43.\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount Jerry has:\n\nAmount left = $50 - Total cost\nAmount left = $50 - $43 = $7.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 7", "answer_solution_clean": "7", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $26.  \nThe cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $12.  \nThe cost of 1 pound of pasta sauce is $5 x 1 = $5.  \n\nNow, we add the costs together:  \nTotal cost = $26 (mustard oil) + $12 (penne pasta) + $5 (pasta sauce) = $43.  \n\nNow, we subtract the total cost from the $50 Jerry has:  \nMoney left = $50 - $43 = $7.  \n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 7", "answer_solution_perturbed": "7"}
