{"id": 957, "question": "A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?", "solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240", "clean_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.", "perturbed_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 639 coals.", "answer": 180.0, "perturbed_answer": 639.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how long the grill ran, we first need to determine how many coals are burned per minute. \n\nThe grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes. Therefore, the rate of burning coals per minute is:\n\n15 coals / 20 minutes = 0.75 coals per minute.\n\nNow, we know the grill burned a total of 180 coals. To find the total time the grill ran, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Total coals burned / Rate of burning coals per minute.\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nTime = 180 coals / 0.75 coals per minute = 240 minutes.\n\nThus, the grill ran for 240 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 240", "answer_solution_clean": "240", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution contains an error in the calculation of the total number of coals burned. The correct calculation is:\n\nThe grill burned 3 bags of coals, and each bag contains 60 coals. Therefore, the total number of coals burned is:\n\n3 * 60 = 180 coals.\n\nNext, we know that the grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes. To find out how many 20-minute intervals are needed to burn 180 coals, we divide the total number of coals by the number of coals burned in each interval:\n\n180 coals / 15 coals per interval = 12 intervals.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of intervals by the time for each interval to find the total grilling time:\n\n12 intervals * 20 minutes per interval = 240 minutes.\n\nThus, the grill ran for 240 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 240", "answer_solution_perturbed": "240"}
