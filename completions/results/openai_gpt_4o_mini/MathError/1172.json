{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 9 wooden planks.", "answer": 50.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "From the partial solution, we know that Colbert has 50 wooden planks from his storage. \n\nNext, we calculate how many planks come from his parents:\nHalf of the total planks (200) come from Colbert's parents:\n200 wooden planks / 2 = 100 wooden planks.\n\nColbert also receives 20 planks from his friends.\n\nNow, we can add up the planks he has from storage, his parents, and his friends:\n50 (from storage) + 100 (from parents) + 20 (from friends) = 170 wooden planks.\n\nTo find out how many planks he needs to buy from the store, we subtract the total number of planks he has from the total number of planks needed:\n200 (total needed) - 170 (total he has) = 30 wooden planks.\n\nThus, the number of planks Colbert needs to buy from the store is 30.\n\nFinal answer: #### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many planks Colbert needs to buy from the store, we first need to calculate how many planks he gets from each source.\n\n1.
