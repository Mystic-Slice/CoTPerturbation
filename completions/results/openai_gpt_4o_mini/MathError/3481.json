Miriam currently has 30 marbles.\n2. She gave her brother 60 marbles, so before that, she had 30 + 60 = 90 marbles.\n3. She then gave her sister twice that amount: 2 * 60 = 120 marbles.\n4. After that, she gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has (which is 30 marbles): 3 * 30 = 90 marbles.\n\nNow, we can calculate how many marbles she started with:\n\n- Starting amount = Current amount + Amount given to brother + Amount given to sister + Amount given to friend\n- Starting amount = 30 + 60 + 120 + 90\n- Starting amount = 30 + 60 + 120 + 90 = 300\n\nThus, Miriam started with 300 marbles.\n\nFinal answer: #### 300", "answer_solution_perturbed": "300"}
