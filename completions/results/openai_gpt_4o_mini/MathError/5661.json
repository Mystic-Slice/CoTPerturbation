{"id": 5661, "question": "The civic league was hosting a pancake breakfast fundraiser.  A stack of pancakes was $4.00 and you could add bacon for $2.00.  They sold 60 stacks of pancakes and 90 slices of bacon.  How much did they raise?", "solution": "The pancakes were $4.00 a stack and they sold 60 stacks for a total of 4*60 = $<<4*60=240.00>>240.00\nThe bacon was $2.00 a slice and they sold 90 slices for a total of 2*90 = $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00\nThey sold $240 in pancakes and $180 in bacon for a total of 240+180 = $<<240+180=420.00>>420.00\n#### 420", "clean_solution": "The pancakes were $4.00 a stack and they sold 60 stacks for a total of 4*60 = $240.00\nThe bacon was $2.00 a slice and they sold 90 slices for a total of 2*90 = $180.00", "perturbed_solution": "The pancakes were $4.00 a stack and they sold 60 stacks for a total of 4*60 = $240.00\nThe bacon was $2.00 a slice and they sold 90 slices for a total of 2*90 = $3670", "answer": 180.0, "perturbed_answer": 3670.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total amount raised, we need to add the total from the pancakes and the total from the bacon.\n\nTotal from pancakes: $240.00  \nTotal from bacon: $180.00  \n\nNow, we add these two amounts together:\n\n$240.00 + $180.00 = $420.00\n\nThus, the total amount raised is:\n\n#### 420", "answer_solution_clean": "420", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The total amount raised from the bacon is incorrect in the partial solution.
