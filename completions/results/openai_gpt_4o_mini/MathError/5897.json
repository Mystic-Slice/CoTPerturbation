{"id": 5897, "question": "Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?", "solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 toy cars\nGrandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 toy cars.\nAll the family together gave Olaf 10 +15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = <<10+15+6+5+10=46>>46.\nAdding the cars Olaf already had, Olaf's collection has 150 + 46 = <<150+46=196>>196 cars.\n#### 196", "clean_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars", "perturbed_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 6 toy cars", "answer": 5.0, "perturbed_answer": 6.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many toy cars Olaf has in total after receiving all the gifts, we need to calculate the total number of cars he received from each family member and then add that to his initial collection.\n\n1. **Initial collection**: 150 cars\n2. **Dad's gift**: 10 cars\n3. **Mum's gift**: 15 cars (10 + 5)\n4. **Auntie's gift**: 6 cars\n5. **Uncle's gift**: 5 cars (6 - 1)\n6. **Grandpa's gift**: Twice as many as the uncle, so 2 * 5 = 10 cars\n\nNow, we can sum up all the gifts:\n- Total gifts = Dad's gift + Mum's gift + Auntie's gift + Uncle's gift + Grandpa's gift\n- Total gifts = 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 46 cars\n\nFinally, we add the total gifts to the initial collection:\n- Total cars = Initial collection + Total gifts\n- Total cars = 150 + 46 = 196\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 196", "answer_solution_clean": "196", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many toy cars Olaf has in total after receiving all the gifts, we need to calculate the total number of cars he received from each family member and then add that to his initial collection.\n\n1. **Initial collection**: 150 cars\n2. **Dad's gift**: 10 cars\n3. **Mum's gift**: 15 cars (10 + 5)\n4. **Auntie's gift**: 6 cars\n5. **Uncle's gift**: 6 cars (1 less than Auntie)\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cars Grandpa gave Olaf. According to the problem, Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Since the uncle gave 6 cars, Grandpa gave:\n\n- **Grandpa's gift**: 2 * 6 = 12 cars\n\nNow, we can sum up all the cars Olaf received:\n\n- Total cars received = Dad's gift + Mum's gift + Auntie's gift + Uncle's gift + Grandpa's gift\n- Total cars received = 10 + 15 + 6 + 6 + 12 = 49 cars\n\nFinally, we add the total cars received to Olaf's initial collection:\n\n- Total cars = Initial collection + Total cars received\n- Total cars = 150 + 49 = 199\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 199", "answer_solution_perturbed": "199"}
