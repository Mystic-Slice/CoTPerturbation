As given, 40% of the 100 soccer balls had holes:\n\nNumber of balls with holes = 40% of 100 = 40 balls.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of balls that did not have holes:\n\nNumber of balls without holes = Total balls - Balls with holes = 100 - 40 = 60 balls.\n\nNow, we know that 20% of the remaining balls (those without holes) were overinflated and exploded. We calculate 20% of the 60 balls:\n\nNumber of balls that exploded = 20% of 60 = 0.20 * 60 = 12 balls.\n\nFinally, we find the number of balls that were successfully inflated and could be used:\n\nNumber of successfully inflated balls = Balls without holes - Balls that exploded = 60 - 12 = 48 balls.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 48", "answer_solution_clean": "48", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution, we first need to correct the calculation of the number of balls with holes. \n\n40% of 100 soccer balls is:\n40/100 * 100 = 40 balls with holes.\n\nThis means the number of balls that could potentially be inflated is:\n100 - 40 = 60 balls.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these remaining balls were overinflated and exploded. According to the problem, 20% of the remaining balls (60) were overinflated. \n\nCalculating 20% of 60:\n20/100 * 60 = 12 balls that exploded.\n\nNow, we subtract the number of balls that exploded from the remaining balls:\n60 - 12 = 48 balls that were inflated successfully and could be used.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n#### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
