{"id": 468, "question": "A shopping center sells T-shirts at $8 each, a sweater at $18,  and a jacket at $80. The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. The sales tax is 5%.  Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, four sweaters, and five jackets for his children. How much does Kevin have to pay for all the items, including the sales tax?", "solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $480 = $<<5/100*480=24>>24.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $<<480+24=504>>504. including the sales tax.\n#### 504", "clean_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.", "perturbed_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $41.", "answer": 72.0, "perturbed_answer": 41.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To complete the solution, we first need to calculate the cost of the five jackets after applying the 10% discount.\n\n1. **Calculate the original cost of the jackets:**\n   - The cost of one jacket is $80.\n   - For five jackets: 5 x $80 = $400.\n\n2. **Apply the 10% discount on the jackets:**\n   - The discount amount is 10% of $400: 0.10 x $400 = $40.\n   - The discounted price for the jackets is: $400 - $40 = $360.\n\n3. **Now, sum up the total cost of all items before tax:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of sweaters + Cost of jackets\n   - Total cost = $48 (T-shirts) + $72 (sweaters) + $360 (jackets) = $480.\n\n4. **Calculate the sales tax:**\n   - The sales tax is 5% of the total cost: 0.05 x $480 = $24.\n\n5. **Calculate the final total cost including sales tax:**\n   - Final total = Total cost + Sales tax = $480 + $24 = $504.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 504", "answer_solution_clean": "504", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To continue the solution:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the five jackets before the discount:\n   Cost of five jackets = 5 x $80 = $400.\n\n2. Calculate the discount on the jackets:\n   Discount on one jacket = 10% of $80 = 0.10 x $80 = $8.\n   Discount on five jackets = 5 x $8 = $40.\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of the jackets after the discount:\n   Total cost of jackets after discount = $400 - $40 = $360.\n\n4. Now, add the costs of T-shirts, sweaters, and jackets:\n   Total cost before tax = $48 (T-shirts) + $72 (sweaters) + $360 (jackets) = $480.\n\n5. Calculate the sales tax:\n   Sales tax = 5% of $480 = 0.05 x $480 = $24.\n\n6. Finally, calculate the total amount Kevin has to pay including sales tax:\n   Total amount = $480 + $24 = $504.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 504", "answer_solution_perturbed": "504"}
