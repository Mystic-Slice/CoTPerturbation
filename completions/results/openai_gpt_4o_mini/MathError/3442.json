{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $44 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.", "answer": 30.0, "perturbed_answer": 44.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution, we need to calculate the earnings from the cupcakes. \n\nFrom the partial solution, we know:\n- Gary can bake 10 cupcakes.\n- He sells each cupcake for $1.\n\nSo, the earnings from the cupcakes will be:\n10 cupcakes * $1 = $10.\n\nNow, we add the earnings from the cakes and the cupcakes:\nEarnings from cakes = $20\nEarnings from cupcakes = $10\n\nTotal earnings = $20 + $10 = $30.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
