{"id": 5384, "question": "An apple tree produced 200 apples in a particular season. The tree made 20% fewer fruits the following season, but the tree fruits production in the second season doubled during the third season.

According to the problem, the production in the third season doubled compared to the second season. Therefore, the production in the third season is:\n\n2 * 160 = 320 apples.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total production over the three seasons:\n\nTotal production = Production in the first season + Production in the second season + Production in the third season\nTotal production = 200 + 160 + 320 = 680.\n\nThus, the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons is:\n\n#### 680", "answer_solution_clean": "680", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons, we need to calculate the production for the third season based on the second season's production.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we have:\n- First season: 200 apples\n- Second season: 160 apples\n\nNow, we need to calculate the production for the third season. The problem states that the production in the second season doubled in the third season.\n\nSo, the production in the third season is:\n160 * 2 = 320 apples\n\nNow, we can calculate the total production over the three seasons:\nTotal production = First season + Second season + Third season\nTotal production = 200 + 160 + 320 = 680 apples\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n#### 680", "answer_solution_perturbed": "680"}
