{"id": 5462, "question": "Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?", "solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = <<3*8=24>>24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = <<3*6=18>>18 miles\nNow add the number of miles both people skated to find the total distance between them: 18 miles + 24 miles = <<18+24=42>>42 miles\n#### 42", "clean_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = 18 miles", "perturbed_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = 19 miles", "answer": 18.0, "perturbed_answer": 19.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "Now, to find the total distance apart, we add the distances that Ann and Glenda skated:\n\nDistance apart = Distance Ann skated + Distance Glenda skated\nDistance apart = 18 miles + 24 miles = 42 miles\n\nThus, the final answer is #### 42", "answer_solution_clean": "42", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total distance apart, we need to add the distances that Ann and Glenda skate. \n\nGlenda skates 24 miles, and Ann skates 18 miles. \n\nSo, the total distance apart is:\n\n24 miles + 18 miles = 42 miles.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 42", "answer_solution_perturbed": "42"}
