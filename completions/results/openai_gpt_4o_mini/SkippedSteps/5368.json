{"id": 5368, "question": "Lisa is making a pizza. She uses 30 pieces of pepperoni for a pizza, twice as many pieces of ham, and 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni. If there are 6 slices of pizza, and everything was distributed evenly, how many pieces of meat altogether are on each slice?", "solution": "There are 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 pieces of ham put on the pizza.\nThere are 30+12 = <<30+12=42>>42 pieces of sausage put on the pizza.\nThere are 30/6 = <<30/6=5>>5 pieces of pepperoni on each pizza slice.\nThere are 60/6 = <<60/6=10>>10 pieces of ham on each pizza slice.\nThere are 42/6 = <<42/6=7>>7 pieces of sausage on each pizza slice.\nThere are 5+10+7 = <<5+10+7=22>>22 pieces altogether on each slice of pizza.\n#### 22", "clean_solution": "There are 30*2 = 60 pieces of ham put on the pizza.", "perturbed_solution": "There are 30*2 = 60 pieces of ham put on the pizza.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total number of pieces of meat on the pizza, we need to calculate the number of pieces of sausage and then sum all the pieces of meat.\n\n1. **Pepperoni**: 30 pieces\n2. **Ham**: 60 pieces (as calculated in the partial solution)\n3. **Sausage**: 30 (pepperoni) + 12 = 42 pieces\n\nNow, we add all the pieces of meat together:\n\nTotal pieces of meat = Pepperoni + Ham + Sausage  \nTotal pieces of meat = 30 + 60 + 42 = 132 pieces\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pieces of meat are on each slice of pizza.
