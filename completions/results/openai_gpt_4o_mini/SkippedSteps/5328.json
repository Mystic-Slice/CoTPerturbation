Mona joined 9 groups, and each group has 4 players (including herself), which gives us a total of 36 player slots filled (as calculated in the partial solution).\n2. However, we need to consider the overlaps:\n   - In one group, she grouped with 2 players she had grouped with before.\n   - In another group, she grouped with 1 player she had grouped with before.\n\nLet's denote:\n- The total number of unique players Mona grouped with as \\( U \\).\n- The 2 players she grouped with before as \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\).\n- The 1 player she grouped with before as \\( P_3 \\).\n\nSince Mona is included in each group, we can express the total number of unique players as:\n\\[ U = 36 - (2 + 1) + 1 \\]\nHere, we subtract the 2 players from the first group and the 1 player from the second group, but we add 1 back because Mona is counted in each group.\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[ U = 36 - 3 + 1 = 34 \\]\n\nThus, the number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend is 34.\n\nFinal answer: #### 34", "answer_solution_clean": "34", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the number of unique players Mona grouped with, we need to account for the repetitions. \n\n1. Mona grouped with 36 players in total (9 groups * 4 players per group).\n2. Out of these, she had previously grouped with 2 players in one group and 1 player in another group. This means there are 3 players that are not unique to this weekend.\n\nTo find the number of unique players, we subtract the repeated players from the total:\n\nUnique players = Total players - Repeated players\nUnique players = 36 - 3 = 33\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
