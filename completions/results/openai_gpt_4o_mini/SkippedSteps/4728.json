{"id": 4728, "question": "Titan's father has an onion farm ready for harvest. He borrows Mr. Clay's pickup and transports the harvest to their store, carrying ten bags per trip, prepared for sale. If the onions are in 50 kgs bags, and the pickup makes 20 trips, what's the total weight of onions harvested by Titan's father?", "solution": "On one trip, the pickup carries 10 bags * 50 kg/bag = <<10*50=500>>500kg of onions\nAfter 20 trips, the total weight of onions transported to the store is 20 trips * 500 kg/trip = <<20*500=10000>>10000 kgs\n#### 10000", "clean_solution": "On one trip, the pickup carries 10 bags * 50 kg/bag = 500kg of onions", "perturbed_solution": "On one trip, the pickup carries 10 bags * 50 kg/bag = 500kg of onions\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total weight of onions harvested, we need to multiply the weight carried in one trip by the number of trips made.\n\nTotal weight = Weight per trip * Number of trips  \nTotal weight = 500 kg/trip * 20 trips = 10000 kg\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 10000", "answer_solution_clean": "10000", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Total weight for 20 trips = 500 kg/trip * 20 trips = 10000 kg\n\n#### 10000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10000"}
