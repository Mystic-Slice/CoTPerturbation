{"id": 997, "question": "Ittymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?", "solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.\nIf they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.", "perturbed_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many fish each of them will be given to eat, we need to determine how many fish correspond to the 24 eyes.\n\nEach fish has 2 eyes, so the total number of fish that corresponds to 24 eyes is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal fish = Total eyes / Eyes per fish = 24 / 2 = 12 fish.\n\nNow, since Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck split the fish equally, we divide the total number of fish by 3:\n\nFish per person = Total fish / Number of people = 12 / 3 = 4 fish.\n\nThus, each of them will be given 4 fish to eat.\n\nFinal answer: #### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many fish Ittymangnark catches, we need to determine how many fish correspond to the 24 eyes.
