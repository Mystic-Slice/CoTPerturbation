{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total hours she has already spent walking dogs from Monday and Wednesday.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Hours spent on Monday walking poodles: 8 hours\n- Hours spent on Monday walking Chihuahuas: 2 hours\n- Hours spent on Tuesday walking Chihuahuas: 2 hours\n- Hours spent on Wednesday walking Labradors: 12 hours\n\nNow, we can sum these hours:\n\nTotal hours spent = 8 (poodles) + 2 (Chihuahuas on Monday) + 2 (Chihuahuas on Tuesday) + 12 (Labradors)  \nTotal hours spent = 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours\n\nCharlotte has a total of 32 hours available for dog-walking this week. Therefore, the remaining hours she can spend on Tuesday walking poodles is:\n\nRemaining hours = Total available hours - Total hours spent  \nRemaining hours = 32 - 24 = 8 hours\n\nSince it takes 2 hours to walk one poodle, we can find out how many poodles she can walk in the remaining 8 hours:\n\nNumber of poodles = Remaining hours / Hours per poodle  \nNumber of poodles = 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = 4 poodles\n\nThus, Charlotte can walk 4 poodles on Tuesday.\n\nFinal answer: #### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total time she has already spent walking dogs from Monday and Wednesday.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Time spent on Monday walking poodles: 8 hours\n- Time spent on Monday walking Chihuahuas: 2 hours\n- Time spent on Tuesday walking Chihuahuas: 2 hours\n- Time spent on Wednesday walking Labradors: 12 hours\n\nNow, let's add these times together:\nTotal time spent = 8 hours (poodles on Monday) + 2 hours (Chihuahuas on Monday) + 2 hours (Chihuahuas on Tuesday) + 12 hours (Labradors on Wednesday)  \nTotal time spent = 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours\n\nCharlotte has a total of 32 hours available for dog walking this week.
