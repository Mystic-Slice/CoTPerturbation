{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the price per pint when not on sale, we divide the total revenue without the sale by the number of pints sold:\n\nPrice per pint without sale = Total revenue without sale / Number of pints sold\nPrice per pint without sale = 324 / 54 = $6.\n\nNow, to find how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale, we subtract the sale price from the regular price:\n\nDifference in price = Price per pint without sale - Price per pint on sale\nDifference in price = 6 - 4 = $2.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the price of a pint of strawberries when not on sale, we can divide the total revenue they would have made by the number of pints sold:\n\nPrice per pint when not on sale = Total revenue when not on sale / Number of pints sold\nPrice per pint when not on sale = 324 / 54 = $6\n\nNow, to find how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale compared to when on sale, we subtract the sale price from the regular price:\n\nDifference in price = Price per pint when not on sale - Price per pint on sale\nDifference in price = 6 - 4 = $2\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
