{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many cupcakes Gary can bake with the remaining 2 pounds of flour, we calculate:\n\n2 pounds of flour for cupcakes / (1/5 pounds of flour per cupcake) = 2 / (1/5) = 2 * 5 = 10 cupcakes.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total earnings from selling the cakes and cupcakes:\n\nEarnings from cakes:\n8 cakes * $2.5 per cake = $20.\n\nEarnings from cupcakes:\n10 cupcakes * $1 per cupcake = $10.\n\nTotal earnings:\n$20 (from cakes) + $10 (from cupcakes) = $30.\n\nThus, Gary will earn a total of $30.\n\nFinal answer: #### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many cupcakes Gary can bake with the remaining 2 pounds of flour, we calculate:\n\n2 pounds of flour for cupcakes / (1/5 pounds of flour per cupcake) = 2 / (1/5) = 2 * 5 = 10 cupcakes.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total earnings from selling the cakes and cupcakes:\n\nEarnings from cakes:\n8 cakes * $2.5 per cake = $20.\n\nEarnings from cupcakes:\n10 cupcakes * $1 per cupcake = $10.\n\nTotal earnings:\n$20 (from cakes) + $10 (from cupcakes) = $30.\n\nThus, Gary will earn a total of $30.\n\nFinal answer: #### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
