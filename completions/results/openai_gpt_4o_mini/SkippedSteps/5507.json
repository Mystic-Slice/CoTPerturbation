{"id": 5507, "question": "John's weight bench can support 1000 pounds.  He wants to make sure to stay 20% under that weight for safety.  If he weighs 250 pounds how much weight can he put on the bar?", "solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=<<1000*.2=200>>200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=<<1000-200=800>>800 pounds\nThat means he can put 800-250=<<800-250=550>>550 pounds on the bar\n#### 550", "clean_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max", "perturbed_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how much weight John can put on the bar, we first need to calculate the maximum weight he can lift while staying 20% under the 1000 pounds limit.\n\n1. Calculate 20% of 1000 pounds:\n   1000 * 0.2 = 200 pounds\n\n2. Subtract this amount from the maximum weight:\n   1000 - 200 = 800 pounds\n\n3. Now, we need to account for John's weight. Since he weighs 250 pounds, we subtract his weight from the adjusted maximum:\n   800 - 250 = 550 pounds\n\nTherefore, the maximum weight John can put on the bar is 550 pounds.\n\nFinal answer: #### 550", "answer_solution_clean": "550", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how much weight John can put on the bar, we first need to calculate the maximum weight he can lift while staying 20% under the 1000 pounds limit.\n\n1.
