{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many hours Sam spent on tutoring for the two months, we first need to calculate the total earnings for both months.\n\n1.

To find the total number of hours he worked, we divide the total earnings by his hourly rate:\n\nTotal hours = Total earnings / Hourly rate\nTotal hours = $550 / $10 = 55\n\nThus, the total number of hours Sam spent on tutoring for the two months is 55.\n\nFinal answer: #### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total hours Sam spent on tutoring for the two months, we first need to calculate the total earnings for both months.\n\n1.
