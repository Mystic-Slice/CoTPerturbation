{"id": 6750, "question": "A Moroccan restaurant received 3 different shipments of couscous. The first two shipments of 7 and 13 pounds arrived on the same day. The next day's shipment was 45 pounds of couscous. If it takes 5 pounds of couscous to make a dish, how many dishes did the restaurant make?", "solution": "The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = <<7+13=20>>20 pounds\nAdding that weight to the next day\u2019s shipment results in a total weight of 20 + 45 = <<20+45=65>>65 pounds\nSince each dish takes 5 pounds, then the restaurant makes 65/5 = <<65/5=13>>13 dishes\n#### 13", "clean_solution": "The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = 20 pounds", "perturbed_solution": "The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = 20 pounds\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "Continuing from the partial solution, we add the weight of the next day's shipment:\n\n20 pounds (from the first two shipments) + 45 pounds (from the next shipment) = 65 pounds of couscous in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many dishes can be made with the total amount of couscous. Since it takes 5 pounds of couscous to make one dish, we divide the total weight by the weight needed for one dish:\n\n65 pounds \u00f7 5 pounds per dish = 13 dishes.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 13", "answer_solution_clean": "13", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The total amount of couscous received is the sum of the first two shipments and the third shipment. \n\nFirst two shipments: \n7 + 13 = 20 pounds\n\nThird shipment: \n20 + 45 = 65 pounds\n\nNow, to find out how many dishes can be made with 65 pounds of couscous, we divide the total pounds by the amount needed for each dish:\n\n65 \u00f7 5 = 13 dishes\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 13", "answer_solution_perturbed": "13"}
