Total scientists = 70\n2. Scientists from Europe = 35 (as calculated)\n3. Scientists from Canada = 70 * (1/5) = 14\n\nNow, we can find the number of scientists from the USA by subtracting the number of scientists from Europe and Canada from the total number of scientists:\n\nScientists from the USA = Total scientists - (Scientists from Europe + Scientists from Canada)\nScientists from the USA = 70 - (35 + 14) = 70 - 49 = 21\n\nThus, the number of scientists in this project who are from the USA is 21.\n\nFinal answer: #### 21", "answer_solution_clean": "21", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many scientists are from Canada, we calculate one-fifth of the total number of scientists:\n\n70 * (1/5) = 14 people from Canada.\n\nNow, we can find the number of scientists from the USA by subtracting the number of scientists from Europe and Canada from the total number of scientists:\n\nTotal scientists = 70  \nScientists from Europe = 35  \nScientists from Canada = 14  \n\nScientists from the USA = Total scientists - (Scientists from Europe + Scientists from Canada)  \nScientists from the USA = 70 - (35 + 14)  \nScientists from the USA = 70 - 49  \nScientists from the USA = 21  \n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 21", "answer_solution_perturbed": "21"}
