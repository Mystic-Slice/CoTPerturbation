{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many grapes Borris needs after increasing his production by twenty percent, we first calculate twenty percent of 180 kilograms.\n\nTwenty percent of 180 kilograms is:\n0.20 x 180 = 36 kilograms.\n\nNow, we add this increase to the original amount:\n180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.\n\nThus, after increasing his production, Borris will need 216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n\nFinal answer: #### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many grapes Borris needs after increasing his production by twenty percent, we first calculate twenty percent of 180 kilograms.\n\nTwenty percent of 180 kilograms is:\n0.20 x 180 = 36 kilograms.\n\nNow, we add this increase to the original amount:\n180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
