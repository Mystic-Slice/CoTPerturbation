{"id": 5897, "question": "Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?", "solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 toy cars\nGrandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 toy cars.\nAll the family together gave Olaf 10 +15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = <<10+15+6+5+10=46>>46.\nAdding the cars Olaf already had, Olaf's collection has 150 + 46 = <<150+46=196>>196 cars.\n#### 196", "clean_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars", "perturbed_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many toy cars Olaf has in total after receiving all the gifts, we need to calculate the total number of cars he received from each family member and then add that to his initial collection.\n\n1. **Initial collection**: 150 cars\n2. **Dad's contribution**: 10 cars\n3. **Mum's contribution**: 15 cars (10 + 5)\n4. **Auntie's contribution**: 6 cars\n5. **Uncle's contribution**: 5 cars (6 - 1)\n6. **Grandpa's contribution**: Twice as many as the uncle, so 2 * 5 = 10 cars\n\nNow, we can sum up all the contributions:\n- Total contributions = Dad's + Mum's + Auntie's + Uncle's + Grandpa's\n- Total contributions = 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 46 cars\n\nFinally, we add the total contributions to the initial collection:\n- Total cars = Initial collection + Total contributions\n- Total cars = 150 + 46 = 196\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 196", "answer_solution_clean": "196", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many toy cars Olaf has in total, we need to calculate the total number of cars he received from each family member and then add that to his initial collection.\n\n1. **Initial collection**: 150 cars\n2. **Dad's contribution**: 10 cars\n3. **Mum's contribution**: 15 cars (10 + 5)\n4. **Auntie's contribution**: 6 cars\n5. **Uncle's contribution**: 5 cars (6 - 1)\n6. **Grandpa's contribution**: Twice the uncle's contribution, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cars\n\nNow, let's sum up all the contributions:\n- Total contributions = Dad's + Mum's + Auntie's + Uncle's + Grandpa's\n- Total contributions = 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 46 cars\n\nNow, we add the total contributions to Olaf's initial collection:\n- Total cars = Initial collection + Total contributions\n- Total cars = 150 + 46 = 196\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 196", "answer_solution_perturbed": "196"}
