{"id": 2226, "question": "Every week of last month Paul tried out a new cake recipe.  The first week, he followed a cake recipe that called for 24 cups of sugar. Each week after that, he reduced the amount of sugar by half. How much sugar did he use for the cake on the fourth week?", "solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = <<24/2=12>>12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups\nThe fourth week, he used 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cups\n#### 3", "clean_solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups", "perturbed_solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "completed_solution_clean": "Continuing from the partial solution:\n\nOn the 3rd week, Paul halved the sugar from the 2nd week, so he used 12/2 = 6 cups.\n\nOn the 4th week, Paul halved the sugar from the 3rd week, so he used 6/2 = 3 cups.\n\nThus, the amount of sugar Paul used for the cake on the fourth week is 3 cups.\n\nFinal answer: #### 3", "answer_solution_clean": "3", "completed_solution_perturbed": "On the 3rd week, Paul halved the sugar again, so he used 12/2 = 6 cups. \n\nOn the 4th week, he halved the sugar once more, so he used 6/2 = 3 cups.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: #### 3", "answer_solution_perturbed": "3"}
