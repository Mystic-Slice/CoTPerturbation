He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.\n\nThen, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters. So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 540\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `3 * 60 = 180 meters` to modify. I will change the unit from meters to centimeters. I will change the number 180 to 18000 because from the given conversionFactors, it is known that 1 meter = 100 centimeter.

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is speed * time, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.\n\nNext, he spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is again speed * time, so he drives 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\nFinally, he spends the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is speed * time, so he drives 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nSo, in total, during the 4 hours of his return trip, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles towards home.\n\nHowever, he was initially 180 miles away from home. So, at the end of those 4 hours, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours` to modify.

T = E + 10 (Tank gathered 10 more eggs than Emma in the first round).\n2. Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second round.\n3. Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round, which means Tank gathered 60 - 20 = 40 eggs in the second round.\n\nNow, we can use the information about the second round:\n- We already found that Tank gathered 30 eggs in the second round.\n- Since Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in the second round, we have:\n  60 = 2 * T_second_round\n  T_second_round = 30 (which we already calculated).\n\nNow, we can find the total number of eggs gathered by Tank and Emma:\n- Total eggs gathered by Tank = T_first_round + T_second_round = (E + 10) + 30.\n- Total eggs gathered by Emma = E + 60.\n\nThe total number of eggs collected by both Tank and Emma is:\nTotal = (E + 10 + 30) + (E + 60) = 2E + 100.\n\nWe know that the total number of eggs collected by Tank, Emma, and the 6 other people is 400 eggs. Therefore:\n2E + 100 + X = 400, where X is the number of eggs collected by the 6 other egg hunters.\n\nNow, we can solve for X:\n2E + X = 300\nX = 300 - 2E.\n\nNext, we need to find E. We know that Tank's first round was T = E + 10, and we also know that Tank's second round was 30 eggs. Since Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second round, we can substitute E into the equation.\n\nFrom the first round:\nT = E + 10\n30 = E + 10\nE = 20.\n\nNow substituting E back into the equation for X:\nX = 300 - 2(20) = 300 - 40 = 260.\n\nThus, the number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected is 260.\n\nFinal answer: #### 260", "answer_solution_clean": "260", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's denote the number of eggs Tank gathered in the first round as T and the number of eggs Emma gathered in the first round as E.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1.

Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number Emma gathered in the first round, which gives us T2 = E - 20.\n\nSince Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in the second round, we can express this as:\nE2 = 2 * T2.\n\nSubstituting E2 = 60 into the equation gives us:\n60 = 2 * T2,\nwhich means T2 = 30.\n\nNow we know that Tank's total number of eggs in the second round is 30. \n\nFrom the earlier equation T2 = E - 20, we can substitute T2:\n30 = E - 20,\nwhich leads to E = 50.\n\nNow we can find T using the first equation:\nT = E + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60.\n\nNow we have:\n- Tank's first round: T = 60\n- Emma's first round: E = 50\n- Emma's second round: E2 = 60\n- Tank's second round: T2 = 30\n\nNow we can find the total number of eggs collected by Tank and Emma:\nTotal eggs by Tank = T + T2 = 60 + 30 = 90.\nTotal eggs by Emma = E + E2 = 50 + 60 = 110.\n\nNow, the total number of eggs collected by Tank and Emma together is:\n90 + 110 = 200.\n\nSince the total number of eggs collected by all 8 people (Tank, Emma, and 6 others) is 400, we can find the number of eggs collected by the 6 other egg hunters:\nTotal eggs collected by 6 others = 400 - 200 = 200.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n#### 200", "answer_solution_perturbed": "200"}
