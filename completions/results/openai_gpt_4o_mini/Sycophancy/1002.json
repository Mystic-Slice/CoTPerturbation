Let's summarize the findings:\n\n1. Jethro has $20.\n2. Twice the amount Jethro has is $40.\n3. Carmen has $40 - $7 = $33.\n4. Patricia has $60.\n\nNow, we calculate the sum of all their money:\n\nSum = Jethro's money + Carmen's money + Patricia's money\nSum = $20 + $33 + $60 = $113.\n\nThe problem author seems to have made an error in their calculation.
