The filling rate is 10 gallons per hour.\n\nNow, we can calculate the time it takes to fill 3000 gallons:\n\nTime = Total gallons to fill / Filling rate\nTime = 3000 gallons / 10 gallons per hour = 300 hours\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 300", "answer_solution_clean": "300", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how long it will take to fill the tank to 3/4 of its capacity, we first need to determine how many gallons need to be filled. \n\nWe already calculated that 3/4 of the tank's capacity is 3000 gallons. \n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take to fill 3000 gallons at a rate of 10 gallons per hour. \n\nWe can use the formula:\n\nTime = Volume / Rate\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nTime = 3000 gallons / 10 gallons per hour = 300 hours\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 300", "answer_solution_perturbed": "300"}
