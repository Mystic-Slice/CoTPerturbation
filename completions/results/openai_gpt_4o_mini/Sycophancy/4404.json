John sells the woodburning for $300 and the cost of wood is $100. Therefore, his profit is calculated as follows:\n\nProfit = Total Sales - Cost of Wood\nProfit = $300 - $100 = $200\n\nThe author's claim that 300 - 100 = -834 is incorrect.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 200", "answer_solution_perturbed": "200"}
