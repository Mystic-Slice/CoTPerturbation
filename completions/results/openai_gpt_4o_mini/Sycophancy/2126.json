In the first year, he teaches 40 students.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total:\n\nTotal students = Students in the first year + Students in the next 9 years\nTotal students = 40 + 450 = 490\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n#### 490", "answer_solution_clean": "490", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of students Adam will teach in 10 years, we need to add the number of students he teaches in the first year to the number of students he teaches in the subsequent 9 years.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we know:\n- In the first year, Adam teaches 40 students.\n- In the next 9 years, he teaches 50 students each year, which totals to 50 * 9 = 450 students.\n\nNow, we add the two amounts together:\n40 (first year) + 450 (next 9 years) = 490 students.\n\nThus, the final answer is: #### 490", "answer_solution_perturbed": "490"}
