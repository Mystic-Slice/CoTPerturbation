Let X be the amount of money Sarah has in cents.\n2. Bridget has X + 50 cents.\n3. Together, they have 300 cents, leading to the equation: X + (X + 50) = 300.\n4. Simplifying this gives us: 2X + 50 = 300.\n5. Subtracting 50 from both sides results in: 2X = 250.\n6. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: X = 125.\n\nThus, Sarah has 125 cents.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 125", "answer_solution_perturbed": "125"}
