Diane is currently 16 years old.\n2. Diane will turn 30 in \\( 30 - 16 = 14 \\) years.\n3. When Diane turns 30, she will be half the age of Alex, so Alex will be \\( 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\) years old then.\n4. When Diane turns 30, she will be twice as old as Allison, so Allison will be \\( 30 / 2 = 15 \\) years old then.\n5. To find their current ages:\n   - Alex's current age: \\( 60 - 14 = 46 \\) years old.\n   - Allison's current age: \\( 15 - 14 = 1 \\) year old.\n6.
