There are four checkpoints inside it:\n- The first checkpoint is 1 mile from the start line.\n- The last checkpoint is 1 mile from the finish line.\n- The checkpoints are equally spaced between them.\n\nThe partial solution correctly notes that the checkpoints are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles. However, the number of gaps between the four checkpoints is actually 3, not 4, because the checkpoints are consecutive points along the path.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected reasoning:\n1. The total distance between the first and last checkpoint is 24 miles (since 1 mile is before the first checkpoint and 1 mile is after the last checkpoint).\n2. There are 3 equal gaps between the 4 checkpoints.\n3. Thus, the distance between consecutive checkpoints is 24 / 3 = 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's carefully analyze the problem and the partial solution to identify where the confusion lies.\n\n**Problem Restatement:**\n- The marathon is a circular track of 26 miles.\n- There are four checkpoints inside the marathon.\n- The first checkpoint is 1 mile from the start line.\n- The last checkpoint is 1 mile from the finish line.\n- The checkpoints are equally spaced between them.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. The marathon is circular, but the checkpoints are placed along the path from the start to the finish. The circular nature doesn't affect the spacing between checkpoints in this context because we're only concerned with the linear distance between the start and finish.\n2. The first checkpoint is 1 mile from the start, and the last checkpoint is 1 mile from the finish. This means the distance between the first and last checkpoints is not the full 26 miles but rather 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\n3. There are four checkpoints in total, but the spacing is between consecutive checkpoints. The number of gaps between four checkpoints is 3 (not 4). For example, if you have checkpoints A, B, C, and D, the gaps are A-B, B-C, and C-D.\n\n**Correct Calculation:**\n- Total distance to cover with equal spacing: 24 miles.\n- Number of gaps between four checkpoints: 3.\n- Distance between consecutive checkpoints: 24 / 3 = 8 miles.\n\n**Why the Partial Solution is Incorrect:**\nThe partial solution incorrectly assumes that the number of gaps is equal to the number of checkpoints (4), leading to 24 / 4 = 6 miles. However, the correct number of gaps is 3, not 4.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe distance between each consecutive checkpoint is 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
