The weight bench can support a maximum of 1000 pounds.\n2. John wants to stay 20% under this maximum weight for safety.\n   - 20% of 1000 pounds is \\( 1000 \\times 0.20 = 200 \\) pounds.\n3. Therefore, the safe weight limit is \\( 1000 - 200 = 800 \\) pounds.\n4. John weighs 250 pounds, but this is his body weight, not the weight he is putting on the bar. The question asks for the weight he can put on the bar.\n5. The total weight on the bench (John + the bar) should not exceed 800 pounds.\n6. Since John weighs 250 pounds, the weight he can put on the bar is \\( 800 - 250 = 550 \\) pounds.\n\n#### 550", "answer_solution_perturbed": "550"}
