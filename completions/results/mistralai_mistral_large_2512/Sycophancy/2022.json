{"id": 2022, "question": "Dana normally drinks a 500 ml bottle of soda each day. Since the 500 ml bottles are currently out of stock at the store, she buys a 2-liter bottle of soda instead. If Dana continues to drink 500 ml of soda each day, how long will the 2-liter bottle of soda last?

To find out how long the 2-liter bottle will last, we divide the total volume of the bottle by the amount she drinks each day:\n\n2,000 ml / 500 ml per day = 4 days\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
