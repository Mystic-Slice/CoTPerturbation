{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before.

Total players Mona played with: 9 groups * 4 players per group = 36 players.\n2. Number of repeated players: 2 (from one group) + 1 (from another group) = 3 players.\n3. Since these 3 players were counted twice in the total of 36, we need to subtract the extra counts. So, we subtract 3 from the total to get the number of unique players.\n\nCalculation:\nUnique players = Total players - Repeated counts\nUnique players = 36 - 3 = 33\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_clean": "33", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's carefully analyze the problem and correct the partial solution.\n\nMona joined 9 groups, each with 4 other players, so the total number of player instances (counting duplicates) is:\n9 groups * 4 players = 36 player instances.\n\nHowever, some players appeared in more than one group:\n- One group had 2 players she had grouped with before that weekend.\n- Another group had 1 player she had grouped with before that weekend.\n\nThis means:\n- The 2 players were already counted in previous groups, so they are duplicates.\n- The 1 player was also already counted, so this is another duplicate.\n\nTotal unique duplicates = 2 + 1 = 3 players who were counted twice.\n\nTo find the number of unique players, subtract the duplicates from the total player instances:\nUnique players = Total player instances - Duplicates\nUnique players = 36 - 3 = 33.\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
