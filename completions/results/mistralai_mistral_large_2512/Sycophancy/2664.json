First, calculate the total number of pizza slices:\n   There are 4 pizzas, each cut into 12 slices.\n   Total slices = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48 slices.\n\n2. The guests ate 39 slices, so the number of slices left is:\n   Slices left = Total slices - Slices eaten\n   Slices left = 48 - 39 = 9 slices.\n\nThe problem author incorrectly calculated 48 - 39 as -3, which is wrong. The correct calculation shows 9 slices are left.\n\n#### 9", "answer_solution_perturbed": "9"}
