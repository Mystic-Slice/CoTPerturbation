We already know there are 100 four-leaf clovers (as calculated in the partial solution: 20% of 500 is 100).\n2. One quarter of these four-leaf clovers are purple.\n3. So, the number of purple four-leaf clovers is 1/4 of 100.\n\nCalculating that:\n1/4 * 100 = 25\n\n#### 25", "answer_solution_clean": "25", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's correct and continue the solution step-by-step.\n\n1. Calculate the number of four-leaved clovers:\n   - 20% of 500 clovers have four leaves.\n   - Number of four-leaved clovers = 20% of 500 = 0.20 * 500 = 100.\n\n2.
