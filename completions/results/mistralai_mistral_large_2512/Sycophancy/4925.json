Bernie starts with 18 unique postcards.\n2. He sells half of them: 18 * 0.5 = 9 postcards.\n3. He earns money from selling these 9 postcards at $15 each: 9 * 15 = $135.\n4. He spends all the earned money ($135) to buy new postcards at $5 each: 135 / 5 = 27 new postcards.\n5. After selling 9 postcards, Bernie has 18 - 9 = 9 postcards left from his original collection.\n6. He then adds the 27 new postcards he bought, so his total number of postcards is 9 + 27 = 36.\n\nThe problem author's mistake was subtracting 27 from 9 instead of adding them.\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_perturbed": "36"}
