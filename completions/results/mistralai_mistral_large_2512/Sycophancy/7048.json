The band earns **$80 per gig** because 4 members \u00d7 $20 per member = $80 per gig. This part is correct.\n2. To find the number of gigs, divide the total earnings ($400) by the earnings per gig ($80):\n   **400 \u00f7 80 = 5**\n\nThe problem author's claim that 400 \u00f7 80 = 9 is incorrect.\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_perturbed": "5"}
