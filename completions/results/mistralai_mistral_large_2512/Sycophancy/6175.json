In that case:\n\nAverage goals per player = Combined total goals / Number of players = 184 / 2 = 92\n\nGiven the phrasing of the question, it is more likely asking for the average goals per game by both players combined, which is 46.\n\nBut to clarify, let's re-examine the question: \"calculate the average number of goals the two scored.\"\n\nThis likely means the average number of goals per game scored by both players combined, which is 46.\n\n#### 46", "answer_solution_perturbed": "46"}
