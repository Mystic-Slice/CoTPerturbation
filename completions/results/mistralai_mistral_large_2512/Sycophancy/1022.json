We know that Rachel is 4 years older than Leah.\n2. If Rachel and Leah were the same age, the sum of their ages would be 30 (as calculated in the partial solution).\n3. Since they are not the same age, we can think of this as splitting the \"extra\" 4 years equally if we were to balance their ages. This means each would have half of 30 if they were the same age.\n4. So, Leah's age would be half of 30: 30 / 2 = 15.\n5. Since Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, Rachel's age is: 15 + 4 = 19.\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_clean": "19", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue the solution step-by-step.\n\n1.
