Each day, the increase is 5 more than the previous day's increase.\n\nLet's correct and complete the solution:\n\n- **Yesterday**: 30 squats (given).\n- **Today**: Increase by 5 from yesterday \u2192 30 + 5 = 35 squats.\n- **Tomorrow**: Increase by 5 more than today's increase (today's increase was 5, so tomorrow's increase is 5 + 5 = 10) \u2192 35 + 10 = 45 squats.\n- **Day after tomorrow**: Increase by 5 more than tomorrow's increase (tomorrow's increase was 10, so the day after tomorrow's increase is 10 + 5 = 15) \u2192 45 + 15 = 60 squats.\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_clean": "60", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's carefully analyze the problem and correct the partial solution.\n\nThe problem states that each day, the number of squats increases by **5 more than the previous day's increase**.\n\nThis means the **increase itself grows by 5 each day**, not that the number of squats increases by a fixed 5 every day.\n\nLet's define the increases properly:\n\n- **Day 1 (yesterday):** 30 squats (given).\n- **Day 2 (today):** Increase from yesterday is 5 (since the problem says \"increase by 5 more than the previous day\" \u2014 but yesterday had no previous increase, so we start with 5).\n  So today: 30 + 5 = 35 squats.\n- **Day 3 (tomorrow):** The increase is 5 more than today's increase. Today's increase was 5, so tomorrow's increase is 5 + 5 = 10.\n  So tomorrow: 35 + 10 = 45 squats.\n- **Day 4 (the day after tomorrow):** The increase is 5 more than tomorrow's increase. Tomorrow's increase was 10, so the day after tomorrow's increase is 10 + 5 = 15.\n  So the day after tomorrow: 45 + 15 = 60 squats.\n\nThus, the number of squats performed the day after tomorrow is **60**.\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_perturbed": "60"}
