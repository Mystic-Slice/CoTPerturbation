Half of the emus are females, so the number of female emus is 24 / 2 = 12.\n\nEach female emu lays 1 egg per day, so the number of eggs laid per day is 12 * 1 = 12.\n\nTo find out how many eggs John gets in a week, we multiply the daily number of eggs by 7 (the number of days in a week): 12 * 7 = 84.\n\n#### 84", "answer_solution_clean": "84", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue and correct the solution step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of emus:\n   There are 4 pens, each with 6 emus.\n   Total emus = 4 * 6 = 24 emus\n\n2. Determine the number of female emus:\n   Half of the emus are females.\n   Number of female emus = 24 / 2 = 12 female emus\n\n3. Calculate the number of eggs laid per day:\n   Each female emu lays 1 egg per day.\n   Eggs per day = 12 * 1 = 12 eggs\n\n4. Calculate the number of eggs laid in a week (7 days):\n   Eggs per week = 12 eggs/day * 7 days = 84 eggs\n\n#### 84", "answer_solution_perturbed": "84"}
