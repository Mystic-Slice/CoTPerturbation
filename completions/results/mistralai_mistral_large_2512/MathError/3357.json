James starts with 100 tennis balls.\n2. He gives away half of them, so he keeps 100 / 2 = 50 tennis balls (not 40 as mentioned in the partial solution).\n3. He then puts the remaining 50 tennis balls into 5 large containers equally.\n4. To find out how many tennis balls go into each container, divide the remaining tennis balls by the number of containers: 50 / 5 = 10.\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10"}
