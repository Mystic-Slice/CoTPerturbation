{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog-walking.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 71 hours spent dog-walking.", "answer": 24.0, "perturbed_answer": 71.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "She has a total of 32 hours available for dog-walking this week, so the remaining hours she can spend walking poodles on Tuesday is 32 - 24 = 8 hours.\n\nSince it takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, the number of poodles she can walk on Tuesday is 8 / 2 = 4 poodles.\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue and correct the partial solution step by step.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we have the following time spent:\n- Monday: 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours\n- Monday: 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours\n- Tuesday: 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours\n- Wednesday: 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours\n\nHowever, the total time calculated in the partial solution (71 hours) is incorrect because it sums the hours incorrectly. Let's recalculate the total time spent on Monday, Tuesday (Chihuahuas only), and Wednesday:\n\nTotal time so far (excluding poodles on Tuesday):\n8 (Monday poodles) + 2 (Monday Chihuahuas) + 2 (Tuesday Chihuahuas) + 12 (Wednesday Labradors) = 24 hours\n\nCharlotte has a total of 32 hours available for the week. Therefore, the remaining time for poodles on Tuesday is:\n32 hours (total) - 24 hours (already accounted for) = 8 hours\n\nSince it takes 2 hours to walk one poodle, the number of poodles she can walk on Tuesday is:\n8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = 4 poodles\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
