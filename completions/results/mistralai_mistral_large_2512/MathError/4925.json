Half of Bernie's collection of 18 postcards is actually 18 * 0.5 = 9 postcards.\n\nNow, let's continue the solution:\n\n1. Bernie sells 9 postcards at $15 each:\n   9 * 15 = $135 earned.\n\n2. He spends all the earned money ($135) to buy new postcards at $5 each:\n   135 / 5 = 27 new postcards.\n\n3. Bernie initially had 18 postcards, sold 9, so he has 18 - 9 = 9 postcards left from his original collection.\n\n4.
