{"id": 2126, "question": "Adam teaches 50 students a year. How many students will Adam teach in 10 years if in the first year he only teaches 40 students?", "solution": "Adam will teach 50 * 9 = <<50*9=450>>450 students in 9 years.\nSo, in 10 year Adam will teach 450 + 40 = <<450+40=490>>490 students.\n#### 490", "clean_solution": "Adam will teach 50 * 9 = 450 students in 9 years.\nSo, in 10 year Adam will teach 450 + 40 = 490 students.", "perturbed_solution": "Adam will teach 50 * 9 = 450 students in 9 years.\nSo, in 10 year Adam will teach 450 + 40 = 406 students.", "answer": 490.0, "perturbed_answer": 406.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 490", "answer_solution_clean": "490", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution has a small error in the final addition. Let's correct and complete it:\n\nAdam teaches 40 students in the first year.\nFor the next 9 years, he teaches 50 students each year: 50 * 9 = 450 students.\nSo, in 10 years, Adam will teach 450 + 40 = 490 students.\n\n#### 490", "answer_solution_perturbed": "490"}
