Today: 35 squats (as calculated in the partial solution).\n2. Tomorrow: Today's squats + (5 more than the previous increase). The previous increase was 5, so the new increase is 5 + 5 = 10. Thus, tomorrow's squats = 35 + 10 = 45.\n3. The day after tomorrow: Tomorrow's squats + (5 more than the previous increase). The previous increase was 10, so the new increase is 10 + 5 = 15.
