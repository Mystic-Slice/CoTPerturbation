{"id": 957, "question": "A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?", "solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240", "clean_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.", "perturbed_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 639 coals.", "answer": 180.0, "perturbed_answer": 639.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To determine how long the grill ran, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of coals burned:**\n   As given in the partial solution, the grill burned 3 bags of coals, and each bag contains 60 coals.\n   So, total coals burned = 3 * 60 = 180 coals.\n\n2. **Find the rate at which coals are burned:**\n   The grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time the grill ran:**\n   - First, find out how many sets of 15 coals are in 180 coals:\n     Number of sets = Total coals burned / Coals burned per set\n     Number of sets = 180 / 15 = 12 sets\n\n   - Each set corresponds to 20 minutes of grilling time.\n     So, total time = Number of sets * Time per set\n     Total time = 12 * 20 = 240 minutes\n\n#### 240", "answer_solution_clean": "240", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue and complete the solution step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of coals burned:\n   The partial solution has a small error in the multiplication. It should be:\n   3 bags * 60 coals/bag = 180 coals.\n\n2. Determine the rate at which coals are burned:\n   The grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes.\n\n3. Calculate the total time the grill ran:\n   First, find out how many sets of 15 coals are in 180 coals:\n   180 coals / 15 coals per set = 12 sets.\n\n   Since each set takes 20 minutes to burn, multiply the number of sets by the time per set:\n   12 sets * 20 minutes/set = 240 minutes.\n\n#### 240", "answer_solution_perturbed": "240"}
