Victoria's population = Richmond's population - 1000 = 3000 - 1000 = 2000 people.\n2. Beacon's population = Victoria's population / 4 = 2000 / 4 = 500 people.\n\nThe partial solution had an error in the final division step (2000 / 4 = 500, not 244).\n\n#### 500", "answer_solution_perturbed": "500"}
