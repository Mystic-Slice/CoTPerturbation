{"id": 4100, "question": "A 26-mile circular marathon has four checkpoints inside it. The first is one mile from the start line, and the last checkpoint is one mile from the finish line. The checkpoints have equal spacing between them. How many miles apart are each of the consecutive checkpoints between the start-finish line?", "solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6 miles apart.\n#### 6", "clean_solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = 6 miles apart.", "perturbed_solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = 7 miles apart.", "answer": 6.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution has a small error in the interpretation of the number of gaps between checkpoints.\n\nThere are 4 checkpoints, which means there are 3 gaps between them (since the first checkpoint is 1 mile from the start and the last is 1 mile from the finish).\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\nThe checkpoints are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 3 equal gaps between the 4 checkpoints, so the distance between consecutive checkpoints is 24 / 3 = 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's carefully analyze the problem and the partial solution to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe marathon is circular with a total distance of 26 miles. There are four checkpoints inside it:\n- The first checkpoint is 1 mile from the start line.\n- The last checkpoint is 1 mile from the finish line.\n- The checkpoints are equally spaced between them.\n\nThe partial solution correctly notes that the checkpoints are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles. However, the number of gaps between the four checkpoints is not 4 but 3 (since the checkpoints are consecutive and equally spaced).\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected reasoning:\n1. Total distance to be divided among the gaps between checkpoints: 24 miles.\n2. Number of gaps between four checkpoints: 3.\n3. Distance between consecutive checkpoints: 24 / 3 = 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
