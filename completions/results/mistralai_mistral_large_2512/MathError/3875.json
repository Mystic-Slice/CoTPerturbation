{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=14 minutes to complete the race.", "answer": 10.0, "perturbed_answer": 14.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the distance of the sidewalk:**\n   The first snail travels at 2 feet per minute and takes 20 minutes to complete the race.\n   Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n   Distance = 2 feet/minute \u00d7 20 minutes = 40 feet\n\n2. **Determine the speed of the third snail:**\n   The second snail travels at twice the speed of the first snail.\n   Speed of the second snail = 2 \u00d7 2 feet/minute = 4 feet/minute\n   The third snail travels at five times the speed of the second snail.\n   Speed of the third snail = 5 \u00d7 4 feet/minute = 20 feet/minute\n\n3. **Calculate the time taken by the third snail:**\n   Time = Distance / Speed\n   Time = 40 feet / 20 feet/minute = 2 minutes\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue and complete the solution step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the distance of the sidewalk:**\n   The first snail travels at 2 feet per minute and takes 20 minutes to complete the race.\n   Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 2 feet/minute \u00d7 20 minutes = 40 feet.\n\n2. **Determine the speed of the second snail:**\n   The second snail travels at twice the speed of the first snail.\n   Speed of second snail = 2 \u00d7 2 feet/minute = 4 feet/minute.\n\n3. **Determine the speed of the third snail:**\n   The third snail travels at five times the speed of the second snail.\n   Speed of third snail = 5 \u00d7 4 feet/minute = 20 feet/minute.\n\n4. **Calculate the time taken by the third snail:**\n   Time = Distance / Speed = 40 feet / 20 feet/minute = 2 minutes.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
