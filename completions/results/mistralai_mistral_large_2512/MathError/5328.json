{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 15 people.", "answer": 36.0, "perturbed_answer": 15.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To determine the number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend, we need to account for the overlaps where she played with some players more than once.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we know that Mona played with a total of 36 player instances (9 groups * 4 players per group).\n\nHowever, some of these players were repeats:\n- In one group, there were 2 players she had grouped with before that weekend. This means these 2 players are counted twice in the 36 player instances.\n- In another group, there was 1 player she had grouped with before that weekend. This player is also counted twice in the 36 player instances.\n\nTo find the number of unique players, we subtract the extra counts of these repeated players:\n- Total player instances: 36\n- Extra counts for the 2 players in the first group: 2 (since they are counted twice, we subtract 1 extra count for each)\n- Extra count for the 1 player in the second group: 1 (since this player is counted twice, we subtract 1 extra count)\n\nSo, the number of unique players is:\n36 - 2 - 1 = 33\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_clean": "33", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's carefully analyze the problem and the partial solution to find the correct number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend.\n\n1. **Total players grouped with (without considering uniqueness):**\n   Mona joined 9 groups, each with 4 other players.\n   So, total players = 9 * 4 = 36 players.\n\n   *(Note: The partial solution incorrectly states 15 people, but since each group has 4 other players, it should be 9 * 4 = 36 players.)*\n\n2. **Adjusting for repeated players:**\n   - In one group, 2 of the 4 players were people Mona had grouped with before that weekend. This means these 2 players are not new (unique) to this weekend.\n   - In another group, 1 of the 4 players was someone Mona had grouped with before that weekend. This player is also not new (unique) to this weekend.\n\n   So, the number of repeated players is 2 (from the first group) + 1 (from the second group) = 3 players.\n\n3. **Calculating unique players for the weekend:**\n   Total players grouped with this weekend = 36.\n   Subtract the repeated players = 36 - 3 = 33.\n\n   However, this counts all players in all groups, but the repeated players are only the ones mentioned (2 in one group and 1 in another). The other players in those groups are unique to this weekend.\n\n   A better way to think about it:\n   - In the group with 2 repeated players, the other 2 players are unique to this weekend.\n   - In the group with 1 repeated player, the other 3 players are unique to this weekend.\n   - In the remaining 7 groups, all 4 players are unique to this weekend.\n\n   So, unique players = (7 groups * 4 players) + (1 group * 2 unique players) + (1 group * 3 unique players) = 28 + 2 + 3 = 33.\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
