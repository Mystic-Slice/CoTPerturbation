{"id": 2540, "question": "Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years. How much money will the art piece have increased by?", "solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $<<12000-4000=8000>>8000\n#### 8000", "clean_solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $8000", "perturbed_solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $8601", "answer": 8000.0, "perturbed_answer": 8601.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 8000", "answer_solution_clean": "8000", "completed_solution_perturbed": "It looks like there's a small error in the partial solution provided. Let's correct and complete it:\n\nThe art piece was bought for $4000 three years ago. In another three years (which is 6 years from the purchase date), the art piece will be worth three times its buying price.\n\nSo, the future value of the art piece is:\n3 * $4000 = $12000\n\nThe increase in the value of the art piece is the future value minus the original purchase price:\n$12000 - $4000 = $8000\n\n#### 8000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8000"}
