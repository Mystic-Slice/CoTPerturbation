{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $2 more when not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $7 more when not on sale.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's carefully review the partial solution to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **On sale price per pint:**\n   The supermarket sold 54 pints for $216.\n   Sale price per pint = $216 / 54 = **$4** (correct).\n\n2. **Total revenue without sale:**\n   The $216 made on sale was $108 less than the revenue without the sale.\n   Revenue without sale = $216 + $108 = **$324** (correct).\n\n3. **Regular price per pint:**\n   The same 54 pints would have sold for $324 without the sale.\n   Regular price per pint = $324 / 54 = **$6** (correct).\n\n4. **Difference in price:**\n   The difference between the regular price and the sale price is $6 - $4 = **$2**.\n\nThe partial solution incorrectly states the difference as $7.
