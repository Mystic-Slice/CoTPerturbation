{"id": 3592, "question": "Tom goes to a combined undergrad and Ph.D. program.  It takes 3 years to finish the BS and 5 years to finish the Ph.D.  Tom finishes it in 3/4ths the time.  How long does it take for him to finish?", "solution": "The program normally takes 3+5=<<3+5=8>>8 years\nSo he manages to finish in 8*3/4=<<8*3/4=6>>6 years\n#### 6", "clean_solution": "The program normally takes 3+5=8 years\nSo he manages to finish in 8*3/4=6 years", "perturbed_solution": "The program normally takes 3+5=8 years\nSo he manages to finish in 8*3/4=8 years", "answer": 6.0, "perturbed_answer": 8.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 6", "answer_solution_clean": "6", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's carefully analyze the partial solution and correct any mistakes.\n\nThe program normally takes 3 years (BS) + 5 years (Ph.D.) = 8 years in total.\n\nTom finishes the program in **3/4ths** of the normal time, so the calculation should be:\n\n8 years * (3/4) = 6 years\n\n#### 6", "answer_solution_perturbed": "6"}
