The partial solution assumes the minimum case where Crabby eats exactly twice as many oysters.\n\nBut since the question asks for the total when Squido eats 200 oysters and Crabby eats **at least** twice that, the smallest possible total is when Crabby eats exactly twice as many.\n\nThus, the total is:\n200 (Squido) + 400 (Crabby) = 600 oysters.\n\n#### 600", "answer_solution_clean": "600", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution has a small error in the final addition.
