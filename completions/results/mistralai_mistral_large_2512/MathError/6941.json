{"id": 6941, "question": "Last Sunday, Logan went to church and realized that the number of children present was 80. If there were 60 male adults, and the total number of people in the church was 200, how many female adults were present?", "solution": "The total number of male adults and children is 80+60 = <<80+60=140>>140 people.\nThe number of females is 200-140 = <<200-140=60>>60 female adults.\n#### 60", "clean_solution": "The total number of male adults and children is 80+60 = 140 people.", "perturbed_solution": "The total number of male adults and children is 80+60 = 233 people.", "answer": 140.0, "perturbed_answer": 233.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the number of female adults present, we subtract the total number of male adults and children from the total number of people in the church.\n\nWe already have:\nTotal number of male adults and children = 140 people\nTotal number of people in the church = 200 people\n\nSo, the number of female adults is:\n200 - 140 = 60\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_clean": "60", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue the solution step by step.\n\n1. We know the total number of people in the church is 200.\n2. The partial solution correctly adds the number of children and male adults: 80 (children) + 60 (male adults) = 140 people.\n3. To find the number of female adults, subtract the number of children and male adults from the total number of people: 200 (total) - 140 (children and male adults) = 60.\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_perturbed": "60"}
