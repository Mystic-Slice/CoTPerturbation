Total emus: 6 emus per pen \u00d7 4 pens = 24 emus (correct).\n2. Female emus: Half of 24 emus = 12 female emus (correct).\n3. Eggs per day: Each female emu lays 1 egg per day, so 12 eggs per day (correct).\n4. Eggs per week: 12 eggs per day \u00d7 7 days = 84 eggs per week.\n\nThe partial solution incorrectly calculated 12 \u00d7 7 as 9, which is wrong.\n\n#### 84", "answer_solution_perturbed": "84"}
