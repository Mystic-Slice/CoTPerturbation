We know the total initial number of seashells collected by Henry, John, and Leo is 59.\n2. Henry and Paul collected a total of 35 seashells (as calculated in the partial solution). However, the question mentions John, not Paul. Assuming this is a typo and Paul is John, we proceed with John.\n3. So, the number of seashells collected by Leo initially is:\n   59 (total) - 35 (Henry and John) = 24 seashells.\n\n4. Leo gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid. A quarter of Leo's collection is:\n   24 / 4 = 6 seashells.\n\n5. After giving away 6 seashells, Leo has:\n   24 - 6 = 18 seashells left.\n\n6. Now, the total number of seashells they have is:\n   Henry's seashells + John's seashells + Leo's remaining seashells\n   = 11 + 24 + 18 = 53.\n\n#### 53", "answer_solution_clean": "53", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's carefully analyze the problem and the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total initial seashells collected by Henry, John, and Leo: 59\n- Henry collected: 11\n- Paul collected: 24 (Note: The problem mentions John initially but then refers to Paul.
