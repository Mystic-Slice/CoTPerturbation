The problem states that **85 paper stars are required to fill one glass jar**. Luke needs to fill **4 bottles (jars)**, so the total number of stars needed is:\n   85 stars/jar \u00d7 4 jars = **340 stars**.\n\n2. Luke has already made **33 stars**, so the number of additional stars he must make is:\n   340 total stars - 33 stars already made = **307 stars**.\n\nThe partial solution incorrectly calculated the second step as 340 - 33 = 914, which is wrong.\n\n#### 307", "answer_solution_perturbed": "307"}
