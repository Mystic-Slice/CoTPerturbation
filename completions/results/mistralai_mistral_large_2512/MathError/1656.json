{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 30 feet long", "answer": 75.0, "perturbed_answer": 30.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To determine how many trees Holly needs to plant along her 75-foot fence, we'll divide the total length of the fence by the width of each tree at maturity.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of trees needed:**\n   - Each tree is 1.5 feet wide.\n   - Total fence length is 75 feet.\n   - Number of trees = Total fence length / Width of each tree\n   - Number of trees = 75 / 1.5 = 50 trees\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - Each tree costs $8.00.\n   - Total cost = Number of trees * Cost per tree\n   - Total cost = 50 * 8 = $400\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_clean": "400", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To determine how many trees Holly needs to plant along her 30-foot fence, we'll divide the total length of the fence by the width of each tree at maturity.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of trees needed:**\n   - Each tree is 1.5 feet wide.\n   - Total fence length is 30 feet.\n   - Number of trees = Total fence length / Width of each tree\n   - Number of trees = 30 feet / 1.5 feet per tree = 20 trees\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - Each tree costs $8.00.\n   - Total cost = Number of trees * Cost per tree\n   - Total cost = 20 trees * $8.00 per tree = $160.00\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_perturbed": "160"}
