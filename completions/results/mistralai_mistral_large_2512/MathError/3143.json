Calculate the total number of candies Amy has.\n   - Chocolate bars: 5\n   - M&Ms: 7 times as many as chocolate bars = 7 * 5 = 35\n   - Marshmallows: 6 times as many as M&Ms = 6 * 35 = 210\n   - Total candies: 5 (chocolate bars) + 35 (M&Ms) + 210 (marshmallows) = 250\n\n   (Note: There was a mistake in the partial solution where the total candies were calculated as 422. The correct total is 250.)\n\n2.
