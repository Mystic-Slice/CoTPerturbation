Let's correct it and continue:\n\nElise buys a total of 15 kg + 10 kg = 25 kg of dog food.\n\nShe now has 40 kg of dog food. To find out how much she already had, we subtract the amount she bought from the total amount she has now:\n\nAmount already had = Total amount now - Amount bought\nAmount already had = 40 kg - 25 kg\nAmount already had = 15 kg\n\n#### 15", "answer_solution_perturbed": "15"}
