{"id": 230, "question": "Emery and Serena go to their school library, and each borrows a copy of The life of Jack Steve's book to read for their school project.

Therefore, Serena will take 5 times longer to read the same book.\n\nSo, Serena's reading time = 5 * Emery's reading time = 5 * 20 = 100 days.\n\nNow, to find the average number of days the two take to read the book, we calculate the arithmetic mean of their reading times:\n\nAverage = (Emery's days + Serena's days) / 2 = (20 + 100) / 2 = 120 / 2 = 60 days.\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_perturbed": "60"}
