If they were the same age, the sum would be 30.\n\nSince there are two people (Rachel and Leah), we divide this adjusted sum by 2 to find Leah's age:\n\nLeah's age = 30 / 2 = 15\n\nNow, since Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, we add 4 to Leah's age to find Rachel's age:\n\nRachel's age = Leah's age + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_clean": "19", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's carefully analyze the problem and the partial solution to find Rachel's age.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n- Rachel is 4 years older than Leah.\n- The sum of their ages is 34.\n- We need to find Rachel's age.\n\n**Partial Solution Analysis:**\nThe partial solution states: \"If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 68.\" This seems to be a misinterpretation or an incorrect step. If Rachel and Leah were the same age, the age difference would be 0, not 4. Therefore, this step does not help us solve the problem correctly.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\nLet's define:\n- Let Leah's age be \\( L \\).\n- Since Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, Rachel's age is \\( L + 4 \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of their ages is 34:\n\\[ L + (L + 4) = 34 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[ 2L + 4 = 34 \\]\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\\[ 2L = 30 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[ L = 15 \\]\n\nNow, find Rachel's age:\n\\[ \\text{Rachel's age} = L + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19 \\]\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "19"}
