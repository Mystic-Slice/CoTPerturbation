{"id": 2877, "question": "Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?", "solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = <<1500/75=20>>20\nThe second route will take 30 hours because 750 / 25 = <<750/25=30>>30\nThe fastest route takes 20 hours because 20 < 30\n#### 20", "clean_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20", "perturbed_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 48", "answer": 20.0, "perturbed_answer": 48.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To determine the fastest route, we need to calculate the time taken for both routes and then compare them.\n\nWe already have the time for the first route:\n- First route time = 20 hours\n\nNow, let's calculate the time for the second route:\n- Second route distance = 750 miles\n- Second route average speed = 25 MPH\n\nTime for the second route = Distance / Speed\nTime for the second route = 750 / 25 = 30 hours\n\nComparing the two routes:\n- First route: 20 hours\n- Second route: 30 hours\n\nThe fastest route is the first one, taking 20 hours.\n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_clean": "20", "completed_solution_perturbed": "It looks like there's a small mistake in the partial solution provided.
