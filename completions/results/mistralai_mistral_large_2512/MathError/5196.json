There are 7 days in a week.\n   So, his current weekly reading time is:\n   \\( 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 14 \\text{ hours} \\)\n\n   (Note: The partial solution incorrectly states \\( 2 \\times 7 = 67 \\). This is a mistake. The correct calculation is \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\).)\n\n2. **Increase in weekly reading time:**\n   Mark wants to increase his weekly reading time by 4 hours.\n   So, the new weekly reading time will be:\n   \\( 14 \\text{ hours} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 18 \\text{ hours} \\)\n\n#### 18", "answer_solution_perturbed": "18"}
