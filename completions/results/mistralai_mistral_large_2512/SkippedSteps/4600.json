Calculate the amount already raised from selling chocolate oranges:\n   - 20 chocolate oranges * $10 each = $200\n\n2. Determine the remaining amount needed to reach $1000:\n   - $1000 (goal) - $200 (already raised) = $800\n\n3. Calculate the number of candy bars Nick needs to sell to raise the remaining $800:\n   - Each candy bar is sold for $5\n   - Number of candy bars = $800 / $5 = 160\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Nick needs to raise a total of $1000.
