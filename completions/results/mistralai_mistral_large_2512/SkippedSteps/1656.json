{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To determine how many trees Holly needs to plant along her 75-foot fence, we'll divide the total length of the fence by the width of each tree at maturity.\n\nEach tree is 1.5 feet wide, so the number of trees needed is:\n75 feet \u00f7 1.5 feet/tree = 50 trees\n\nNow, to find the total cost, multiply the number of trees by the cost per tree:\n50 trees \u00d7 $8.00/tree = $400.00\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_clean": "400", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To determine how many trees Holly needs to plant along her 75-foot fence, we'll divide the total length of the fence by the width of each tree at maturity.\n\n1.
