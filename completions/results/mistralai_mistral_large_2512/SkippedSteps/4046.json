{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total number of hours Sam spent tutoring over the two months, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings for the two months:\n   - First month: $200\n   - Second month: $350 (as calculated in the partial solution)\n   - Total earnings = $200 + $350 = $550\n\n2. Determine the number of hours worked based on the hourly rate:\n   - Hourly rate = $10/hour\n   - Total hours = Total earnings / Hourly rate\n   - Total hours = $550 / $10 per hour = 55 hours\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "For the two months combined, Sam earned $200 (first month) + $350 (second month) = $550.\n\nTo find the total number of hours Sam spent tutoring, divide the total earnings by the hourly rate:\n$550 \u00f7 $10/hour = 55 hours.\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_perturbed": "55"}
