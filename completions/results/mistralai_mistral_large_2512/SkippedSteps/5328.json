{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To determine the number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend, we need to account for the overlaps where she played with some players more than once.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we know that Mona played with a total of 36 players if we count each player in every group separately. However, some players were in more than one group with her:\n\n1. One group had 2 players she had grouped with before that weekend. This means these 2 players are counted twice in the 36 total.\n2. Another group had 1 player she had grouped with before that weekend. This player is also counted twice in the 36 total.\n\nTo find the number of unique players, we subtract the overlaps from the total count:\n\n- Total players counted: 36\n- Overlaps: 2 (from the first group) + 1 (from the second group) = 3\n\nHowever, we need to adjust the calculation because the overlaps are already included in the 36 count. Specifically, the 2 players from the first group and the 1 player from the second group were each counted an extra time (since they were already counted once before).\n\nThus, the number of unique players is:\n\n36 (total counted) - 3 (extra counts) = 33\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_clean": "33", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To determine the number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend, we need to account for the repeated players in the groups.\n\n1.
