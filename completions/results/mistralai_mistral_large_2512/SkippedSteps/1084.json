{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Continuing from the partial solution:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost for both Billy and Jenny:\n   Since each meal costs $25, the total cost for two meals is 25 * 2 = 50.\n\n2.
