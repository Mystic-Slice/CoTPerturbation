Let x be the age of Markus's grandson.\n2. Markus's son is twice the age of Markus's grandson, so the son's age is 2x.\n3. Markus is twice the age of his son, so Markus's age is 2 * (2x) = 4x.\n4. The sum of their ages is 140 years, so we can write the equation:\n   x + 2x + 4x = 140\n5. Combine like terms:\n   7x = 140\n6.
