We know that Rachel is 4 years older than Leah.\n2. If Rachel and Leah were the same age, the sum of their ages would be 30 (as calculated in the partial solution).\n3. Since Rachel is actually 4 years older, we can think of the sum as being split equally between them, but with Rachel having an extra 4 years.\n4. To find Leah's age, we subtract the 4 years from the adjusted sum and then divide by 2:\n   Leah's age = (30 / 2) = 15 years.\n5. Since Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, Rachel's age is:\n   Rachel's age = Leah's age + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19.\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "19"}
