{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.

We know the first snail's speed is 2 feet per minute, and it took 20 minutes to complete the race. The distance of the sidewalk can be calculated as:\n   Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 2 feet/minute \u00d7 20 minutes = 40 feet.\n\n2. The second snail's speed is twice the speed of the first snail:\n   Speed of second snail = 2 \u00d7 2 feet/minute = 4 feet/minute.\n\n3. The third snail's speed is five times the speed of the second snail:\n   Speed of third snail = 5 \u00d7 4 feet/minute = 20 feet/minute.\n\n4. Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the third snail to travel the 40-foot sidewalk:\n   Time = Distance / Speed = 40 feet / 20 feet/minute = 2 minutes.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the distance of the sidewalk:**\n   The first snail travels at 2 feet per minute and takes 20 minutes to complete the race.\n   Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n   Distance = 2 feet/minute \u00d7 20 minutes = 40 feet\n\n2. **Determine the speed of the second snail:**\n   The second snail travels at twice the speed of the first snail.\n   Speed of second snail = 2 \u00d7 2 feet/minute = 4 feet/minute\n\n3. **Determine the speed of the third snail:**\n   The third snail travels at five times the speed of the second snail.\n   Speed of third snail = 5 \u00d7 4 feet/minute = 20 feet/minute\n\n4. **Calculate the time taken by the third snail:**\n   Time = Distance / Speed\n   Time = 40 feet / 20 feet/minute = 2 minutes\n\nTherefore, the third snail takes 2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
