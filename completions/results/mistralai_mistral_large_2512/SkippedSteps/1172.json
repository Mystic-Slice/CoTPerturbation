{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "From Colbert\u2019s parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = 100 wooden planks.\nFrom Colbert\u2019s friends, there are 20 wooden planks.\nTotal planks from storage, parents, and friends = 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 wooden planks.\nPlanks Colbert needs to buy from the store = 200 - 170 = 30 wooden planks.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "From Colbert\u2019s parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = 100 wooden planks.\nFrom Colbert\u2019s friends, there are 20 wooden planks.\n\nNow, let's add up all the planks Colbert already has:\n50 (from storage) + 100 (from parents) + 20 (from friends) = 170 wooden planks.\n\nTo find out how many planks Colbert needs to buy from the store, subtract the planks he already has from the total number of planks needed:\n200 (total planks needed) - 170 (planks he already has) = 30 wooden planks.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
