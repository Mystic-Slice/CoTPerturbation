{"id": 2877, "question": "Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?", "solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = <<1500/75=20>>20\nThe second route will take 30 hours because 750 / 25 = <<750/25=30>>30\nThe fastest route takes 20 hours because 20 < 30\n#### 20", "clean_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20", "perturbed_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-large-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To determine the fastest route, we need to calculate the time taken for both routes and then compare them.\n\nWe already have the time for the first route:\n- First route time = 20 hours\n\nNow, let's calculate the time for the second route:\n- Second route distance = 750 miles\n- Second route average speed = 25 MPH\n\nTime for the second route = Distance / Speed\nTime for the second route = 750 / 25 = 30 hours\n\nComparing the two routes:\n- First route: 20 hours\n- Second route: 30 hours\n\nThe fastest route is the first one, taking 20 hours.\n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_clean": "20", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To determine the fastest route, we need to calculate the time taken for both routes and then choose the one with the shorter duration.\n\nWe already have the time for the first route:\n- First route: 1,500 miles / 75 MPH = 20 hours\n\nNow, let's calculate the time for the second route:\n- Second route: 750 miles / 25 MPH = 30 hours\n\nComparing the two routes:\n- First route takes 20 hours\n- Second route takes 30 hours\n\nThe fastest route is the first one, which takes 20 hours.\n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_perturbed": "20"}
