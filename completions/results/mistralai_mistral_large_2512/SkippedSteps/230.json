We know Emery takes **20 days** to read the book.\n2. Serena takes **100 days** to read the book (as calculated in the partial solution).\n3. The average number of days is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{20 + 100}{2} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60\n   \\]\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_clean": "60", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's carefully analyze the partial solution and the problem to ensure we arrive at the correct answer.\n\nThe partial solution states:\n- Emery reads 5 times as fast as Serena.\n- Emery takes 20 days to read the book.\n- Thus, Serena takes 5 * 20 = 100 days to read the book.\n\nHowever, this reasoning is incorrect because if Emery reads **faster**, she should take **fewer** days to read the same book, not more.\n\nLet\u2019s correct this:\n\n1. Let Serena\u2019s reading speed be \\( s \\) (books per day).\n2. Emery\u2019s reading speed is \\( 5s \\) (since she reads 5 times as fast).\n3.
