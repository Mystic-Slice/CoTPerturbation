Let's re-examine the partial solution again. We already calculated that the total weight of couscous is 65 pounds, and each dish takes 5 pounds. To find the total number of dishes, we divide the total weight by the weight per dish:\n\n65 \u00f7 5 = 13\n\nBut we also need to consider the first shipment of couscous, which was 7 pounds. We can calculate the number of dishes made with this shipment:\n\n7 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nNow, let's add the number of dishes made with the first shipment to the number of dishes made with the remaining shipments:\n\n1 + (13 + 45) \u00f7 5 = 1 + 58 \u00f7 5 = 1 + 11.6 = 12.6\n\nHowever, this is still not the correct answer.
