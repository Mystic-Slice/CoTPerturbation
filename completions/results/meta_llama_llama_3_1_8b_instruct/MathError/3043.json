Since Sam took half of Mark's buttons, we need to divide the total number of buttons Mark had by 2.\n\nMark had 56 buttons after Shane gave him 42 buttons. So, before Shane gave him buttons, Mark had 56 - 42 = 14 buttons.\n\nSam took half of Mark's buttons, which is 14 / 2 = 7 buttons.\n\nNow, let's subtract the buttons Sam took from the total number of buttons Mark had after Shane gave him buttons:\n\n56 - 7 = 49\n\nSo, Mark ended up with 49 buttons.\n\n#### 49", "answer_solution_clean": "49", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Since Mark had 54 buttons and Sam asked for half of them, we need to find half of 54.\n\nHalf of 54 is 54/2 = 27.\n\nSo, Sam took 27 buttons from Mark.\n\nMark was left with 54 - 27 = 27 buttons.\n\nTherefore, Mark ended up with 27 buttons.\n\n#### 27", "answer_solution_perturbed": "27"}
