{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = 36.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = 81.", "answer": 36.0, "perturbed_answer": 81.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total amount of grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing his production, we need to add the increase to the original amount.\n\nTotal grapes needed per year = Original amount + Increase\n= 180 + 36\n= 216\n\nSo, Borris needs 216 kilograms of grapes per year after increasing his production.\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total amount of grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing his production, we need to add the original amount to the increase.\n\nTotal grapes needed per year = Original amount + Increase\n= 180 + 36 (not 81, since the increase is 20% of 180, which is 36)\n= 216\n\nSo, the total amount of grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing his production is 216 kilograms.\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
