{"id": 1022, "question": "Rachel is 4 years older than Leah. If the sum of their ages is 34, how old is Rachel?", "solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = <<34-4=30>>30.\nSo Leah would be 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 years old.\nHence, Rachel is 15 + 4 = <<15+4=19>>19 years old.\n#### 19", "clean_solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 30.", "perturbed_solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 68.", "answer": 30.0, "perturbed_answer": 68.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's continue with the partial solution.\n\nSince Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, we can represent Leah's age as x and Rachel's age as x + 4.\n\nThe sum of their ages is 34, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (x + 4) = 34\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x + 4 = 34\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n2x = 30\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 15\n\nSo Leah is 15 years old.
