{"id": 6280, "question": "Janet buys a multi-flavor pack of cheese sticks. 15 of the sticks are cheddar, 30 are mozzarella, and 45 are pepperjack. If Janet picks a cheese stick at random, what is the percentage chance it will be pepperjack?", "solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = <<15+30+45=90>>90 cheese sticks\nThen divide the number of pepperjack sticks by the total number of cheese sticks and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 45 pepperjack sticks / 90 cheese sticks * 100% = 50%\n#### 50", "clean_solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 90 cheese sticks", "perturbed_solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 57 cheese sticks", "answer": 90.0, "perturbed_answer": 57.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the percentage chance that Janet will pick a pepperjack cheese stick, we need to divide the number of pepperjack sticks by the total number of sticks and multiply by 100.\n\nNumber of pepperjack sticks: 45\nTotal number of sticks: 90\n\nPercentage chance = (45 / 90) x 100\n= 0.5 x 100\n= 50%\n\nSo, the percentage chance that Janet will pick a pepperjack cheese stick is 50%.\n\n#### 50", "answer_solution_clean": "50", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the percentage chance that the cheese stick will be pepperjack, we need to divide the number of pepperjack cheese sticks by the total number of cheese sticks, and then multiply by 100.\n\nNumber of pepperjack cheese sticks: 45\nTotal number of cheese sticks: 90 (not 57, as mentioned in the partial solution, which was incorrect)\n\nPercentage chance = (45 / 90) x 100\n= 0.5 x 100\n= 50%\n\nSo, the percentage chance that the cheese stick will be pepperjack is 50%.\n\n#### 50", "answer_solution_perturbed": "50"}
