So, the total number of flowers used in 15 bouquets of narcissus is 15 * 5 = 75 flowers.\n\nSince there are 75 narcissus flowers and 90 chrysanthemums, the remaining flowers after making 15 bouquets of narcissus are 90 - 75 = 15 chrysanthemums.\n\nWe can make 15 / 5 = 3 bouquets of chrysanthemums with the remaining flowers.\n\nSo, the total number of bouquets that can be made is 15 (narcissus) + 3 (chrysanthemums) = 18 bouquets.\n\n#### 18", "answer_solution_clean": "18", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of bouquets the florist can make, we need to add the number of bouquets of narcissus and chrysanthemums.\n\nNumber of bouquets of narcissus = 15\nNumber of bouquets of chrysanthemums = 30\n\nTotal number of bouquets = 15 + 30 = 45\n\nSince each bouquet contains 5 flowers, we can also multiply the total number of bouquets by 5 to get the total number of flowers used.\n\nTotal number of flowers used = 45 * 5 = 225\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of bouquets, not the total number of flowers. Therefore, the final answer is the total number of bouquets.\n\n#### 45", "answer_solution_perturbed": "45"}
