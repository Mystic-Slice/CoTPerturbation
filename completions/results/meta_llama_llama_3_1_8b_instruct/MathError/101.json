{"id": 101, "question": "Marcy is a makeup artist and has agreed to do some makeup for her friend's wedding. The only makeup she has limited stock of is lip gloss so she counts how many tubes she needs. Each tube of lip gloss will hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. Marcy decides to bring 6 tubs of lip gloss, each of which holds 2 tubes of lip gloss, and this will be the exact amount she needs for everyone's makeup. How many people is Marcy painting with makeup?", "solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = <<6*2=12>>12 tubes of lip gloss.\nSo she must be applying makeup to 12 tubes of lip gloss * 3 people per tube of lip gloss = <<12*3=36>>36 people.\n#### 36", "clean_solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = 12 tubes of lip gloss.", "perturbed_solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = 50 tubes of lip gloss.", "answer": 12.0, "perturbed_answer": 50.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "Since each tube of lip gloss can hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup, and Marcy has 12 tubes of lip gloss, we can multiply the number of tubes by the number of people each tube can cover:\n\n12 tubes of lip gloss * 3 people per tube = 36 people\n\nSo, Marcy will be painting with makeup for 36 people.\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_clean": "36", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of people Marcy can paint with makeup, we need to multiply the total number of tubes of lip gloss by the number of people each tube can cover.\n\nSince each tube of lip gloss can cover 3 people, and Marcy has 50 tubes of lip gloss, we multiply 50 by 3:\n\n50 * 3 = 150\n\nSo, Marcy can paint 150 people with makeup.\n\n#### 150", "answer_solution_perturbed": "150"}
