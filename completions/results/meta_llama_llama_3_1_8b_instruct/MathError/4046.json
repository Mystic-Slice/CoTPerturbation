{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = 55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = 27 hours on math tutoring for the first two months", "answer": 55.0, "perturbed_answer": 27.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "Since Sam earns $10 an hour, we can calculate the total hours he spent on tutoring for the first two months by dividing the total amount he earned ($550) by his hourly wage ($10).\n\n$550 \u00f7 $10 = 55 hours\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Since the problem asks for the hours spent on tutoring for two months, and the partial solution already calculates the total hours for two months, the final answer is:\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_perturbed": "55"}
