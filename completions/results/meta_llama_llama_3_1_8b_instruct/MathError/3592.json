{"id": 3592, "question": "Tom goes to a combined undergrad and Ph.D. program.  It takes 3 years to finish the BS and 5 years to finish the Ph.D.  Tom finishes it in 3/4ths the time.  How long does it take for him to finish?", "solution": "The program normally takes 3+5=<<3+5=8>>8 years\nSo he manages to finish in 8*3/4=<<8*3/4=6>>6 years\n#### 6", "clean_solution": "The program normally takes 3+5=8 years\nSo he manages to finish in 8*3/4=6 years", "perturbed_solution": "The program normally takes 3+5=8 years\nSo he manages to finish in 8*3/4=8 years", "answer": 6.0, "perturbed_answer": 8.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total time it takes for Tom to finish the program, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total time.\n\nThe program normally takes 3 + 5 = 8 years.\n\nSo, Tom finishes it in 8 * 3/4 = 6 years.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n#### 6", "answer_solution_clean": "6", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution is incorrect.
