{"id": 3018, "question": "Kara has to drink 4 ounces of water every time she takes her medication. Her medication instructions are to take one tablet three times a day. She followed the instructions for one week, but in the second week, she forgot twice on one day. How many ounces of water did she drink with her medication over those two weeks?", "solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = <<84*2=168>>168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = <<168-8=160>>160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = 8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = 160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.", "perturbed_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = 8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = 105 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.", "answer": 160.0, "perturbed_answer": 105.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "Since Kara forgot two tablets on one day, she didn't drink 8 ounces of water on that day. However, she still drank 12 ounces of water on that day (for the one tablet she took). So, she actually drank 12 - 4 = 8 ounces less than usual on that day, not 8 ounces more. Therefore, she drank 8 ounces less than usual on that day, not 8 ounces more.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she drank 12 - 4 = 8 ounces less than usual on that day.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = 160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.\n\nHowever, since she drank 8 ounces less than usual on that day, we need to subtract 8 ounces from the total amount of water she drank in two weeks. But we already did that in the previous step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total amount of water Kara drank over two weeks, we need to subtract the amount she forgot to drink from the total amount she would have drunk if she followed the instructions perfectly.\n\nKara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = 8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = 160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_perturbed": "160"}
