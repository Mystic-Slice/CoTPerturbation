{"id": 4600, "question": "Nick is trying to raise money for a charity. He is selling candy bars for $5. He is also selling chocolate oranges for $10. He wants to raise $1000. He only had 20 chocolate oranges that he sold out. How many candy bars does Nick need to sell to reach his goal?", "solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $<<20*10=200>>200 from the chocolate oranges.\nThis means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800.\nHe needs to sell a total of $800 / $5 = <<800/5=160>>160 candy bars to reach his goal.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $200 from the chocolate oranges.\nThis means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $800.", "perturbed_solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $200 from the chocolate oranges.\nThis means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $348.", "answer": 800.0, "perturbed_answer": 348.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "Since Nick needs to raise another $800 and each candy bar is sold for $5, we can divide the amount he needs to raise by the price of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars he needs to sell:\n\n$800 \u00f7 $5 = 160\n\nSo, Nick needs to sell 160 candy bars to reach his goal.\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Since Nick needs to raise $348 and each candy bar is sold for $5, we can divide the amount he needs to raise by the price of each candy bar to find out how many he needs to sell:\n\n$348 / $5 = 69.6\n\nSince Nick can't sell a fraction of a candy bar, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he reaches his goal.
