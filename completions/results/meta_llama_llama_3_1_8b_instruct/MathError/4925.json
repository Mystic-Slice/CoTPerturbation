{"id": 4925, "question": "Bernie has a collection of 18 unique postcards. He decided to sell half his collection for $15 per postcard. After he has successfully sold his postcards he decided to spend all the earned money to buy new postcards for $5 each. How many postcards does Bernie have after all his transactions?", "solution": "Half of Bernie's collection means 18 * 0.5 = <<18*0.5=9>>9 postcards.\nSo he was able to sell 9 postcards for 9 * 15 = $<<9*15=135>>135.\nHe decided to spend all of his money on new postcards for $5 each, so he was able to buy 135 / 5 = 27 new postcards.\nThis means Bernie has 9 + 27 = <<9+27=36>>36 postcards after all.\n#### 36", "clean_solution": "Half of Bernie's collection means 18 * 0.5 = 9 postcards.", "perturbed_solution": "Half of Bernie's collection means 18 * 0.5 = 4 postcards.", "answer": 9.0, "perturbed_answer": 4.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total amount of money Bernie earned from selling his postcards, we multiply the number of postcards sold by the price per postcard: 9 * $15 = $135.\n\nSince Bernie spent all the earned money to buy new postcards for $5 each, we divide the total amount of money by the price per postcard to find the number of new postcards he bought: $135 / $5 = 27.\n\nNow, we add the number of postcards Bernie had left after selling his collection (9) to the number of new postcards he bought (27) to find the total number of postcards he has after all his transactions: 9 + 27 = 36.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_clean": "36", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To continue the solution, we need to calculate the total amount of money Bernie earned from selling half of his postcards.\n\nSince Bernie sold half of his 18 postcards, he sold 9 postcards (18 * 0.5 = 9). He sold each postcard for $15, so the total amount of money he earned is:\n9 * 15 = 135\n\nNow, Bernie uses this money to buy new postcards for $5 each. To find out how many new postcards he can buy, we divide the total amount of money he earned by the cost of each new postcard:\n135 / 5 = 27\n\nSo, Bernie buys 27 new postcards. To find the total number of postcards he has after all his transactions, we add the number of new postcards to the number of postcards he had left after selling half of his collection (which is 9, since he sold the other half). \n9 + 27 = 36\n\nTherefore, Bernie has 36 postcards after all his transactions.\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_perturbed": "36"}
