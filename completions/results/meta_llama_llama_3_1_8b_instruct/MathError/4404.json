{"id": 4404, "question": "John sells 20 woodburning for $15 each.  The wood cost $100.  How much does he make in profit?", "solution": "He sells the woodburning for 20*15=$<<20*15=300>>300\nSo he makes a profit of 300-100=$<<300-100=200>>200\n#### 200", "clean_solution": "He sells the woodburning for 20*15=$300\nSo he makes a profit of 300-100=$200", "perturbed_solution": "He sells the woodburning for 20*15=$300\nSo he makes a profit of 300-100=$545", "answer": 200.0, "perturbed_answer": 545.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the woodburnings and subtract the cost of the wood.\n\nThe total revenue from selling the woodburnings is 20 * 15 = $300.\n\nThe cost of the wood is $100.\n\nSo, the profit is 300 - 100 = $200.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We need to consider the cost of the woodburnings as well. Since the problem doesn't mention the cost of the woodburnings, we will assume that the cost of the woodburnings is included in the selling price of $15 each.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 200", "answer_solution_clean": "200", "completed_solution_perturbed": "It seems like there's a mistake in the partial solution. If John sells 20 woodburning for $15 each, the total revenue would be 20*15 = $300. Then, subtracting the cost of the wood ($100) from the total revenue ($300) would give the profit.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\nProfit = Total Revenue - Cost\n= 300 - 100\n= 200\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n#### 200", "answer_solution_perturbed": "200"}
