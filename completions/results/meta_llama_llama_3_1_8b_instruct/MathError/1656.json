{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 30 feet long", "answer": 75.0, "perturbed_answer": 30.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total number of trees Holly can plant, we need to divide the length of her fence (75 feet) by the width of each tree (1.5 feet).\n\nNumber of trees = Length of fence / Width of each tree\n= 75 feet / 1.5 feet\n= 50 trees\n\nSince each tree costs $8.00, the total cost will be:\n\nTotal cost = Number of trees * Cost per tree\n= 50 trees * $8.00\n= $400.00\n\nHowever, the question asks for the final answer as a number without any special characters or spaces.
