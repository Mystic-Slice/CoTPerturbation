Since Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon, we can set up the equation:\n\n4x = 2000\n\nwhere x is the number of people in Beacon.\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\nx = 2000 / 4\nx = 500\n\nSo, Beacon has 500 people.\n\n#### 500", "answer_solution_perturbed": "500"}
