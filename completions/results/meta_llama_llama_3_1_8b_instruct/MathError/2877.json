{"id": 2877, "question": "Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?", "solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = <<1500/75=20>>20\nThe second route will take 30 hours because 750 / 25 = <<750/25=30>>30\nThe fastest route takes 20 hours because 20 < 30\n#### 20", "clean_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20", "perturbed_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 48", "answer": 20.0, "perturbed_answer": 48.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the time it takes for the second route, we need to divide the distance by the speed.\n\n750 miles / 25 MPH = 30 hours\n\nSince the first route takes 20 hours and the second route takes 30 hours, the fastest route is the first one.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 20", "answer_solution_clean": "20", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the time it takes for the second route, we need to divide the distance by the speed.\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 25\nTime = 30 hours\n\nSince the first route takes 20 hours and the second route takes 30 hours, the fastest route is the first one.\n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_perturbed": "20"}
