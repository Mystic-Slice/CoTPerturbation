Let's correct it.\n\nWe know that Sarah and Bridget combined have 300 cents, and Bridget has 50 cents more than Sarah. Let's represent the amount of money Sarah has as X. Then, the amount of money Bridget has is X + 50.\n\nThe equation is: X + (X + 50) = 300\n\nCombine like terms: 2X + 50 = 300\n\nSubtract 50 from both sides: 2X = 250\n\nDivide both sides by 2: X = 125\n\nSo, Sarah has 125 cents.\n\n#### 125", "answer_solution_perturbed": "125"}
