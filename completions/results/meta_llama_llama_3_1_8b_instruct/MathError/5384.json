{"id": 5384, "question": "An apple tree produced 200 apples in a particular season. The tree made 20% fewer fruits the following season, but the tree fruits production in the second season doubled during the third season. Calculate the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons.", "solution": "If the tree produced 200 apples in the first season, there were 20/100*200 = 40 fewer fruits in the second season.\nThe total production from the apple tree in the second season is 200-40 = <<200-40=160>>160\nIn the two seasons, the apple tree produced 160+200 = <<160+200=360>>360 fruits.\nThe apple tree doubled the number of fruits it produced in the third season, totaling 160*2 = <<160*2=320>>320.\nIn the three seasons, the apple tree produced 320+360 = <<320+360=680>>680 apples.\n#### 680", "clean_solution": "If the tree produced 200 apples in the first season, there were 20/100*200 = 40 fewer fruits in the second season.\nThe total production from the apple tree in the second season is 200-40 = 160\nIn the two seasons, the apple tree produced 160+200 = 360 fruits.", "perturbed_solution": "If the tree produced 200 apples in the first season, there were 20/100*200 = 40 fewer fruits in the second season.\nThe total production from the apple tree in the second season is 200-40 = 160\nIn the two seasons, the apple tree produced 160+200 = 661 fruits.", "answer": 360.0, "perturbed_answer": 661.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons, we need to calculate the production of the third season.\n\nSince the tree's fruit production in the second season doubled during the third season, the production in the third season is 2 * 160 = 320.\n\nNow, we add the production of all three seasons: 200 (first season) + 160 (second season) + 320 (third season) = 680.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons is 680.\n\n#### 680", "answer_solution_clean": "680", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Since the tree's fruit production in the second season doubled during the third season, the number of fruits in the third season is 2 * 160 = 320.\n\nThe total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons is 200 + 160 + 320 = 680.\n\n#### 680", "answer_solution_perturbed": "680"}
