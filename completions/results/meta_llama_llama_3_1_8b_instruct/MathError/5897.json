{"id": 5897, "question": "Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?", "solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 toy cars\nGrandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 toy cars.\nAll the family together gave Olaf 10 +15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = <<10+15+6+5+10=46>>46.\nAdding the cars Olaf already had, Olaf's collection has 150 + 46 = <<150+46=196>>196 cars.\n#### 196", "clean_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars", "perturbed_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 6 toy cars", "answer": 5.0, "perturbed_answer": 6.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's continue the solution.\n\nWe know that Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Since the uncle gave 5 toy cars, Grandpa gave 2 x 5 = 10 toy cars.\n\nWe also know that Mum gave Olaf 15 toy cars, and Dad gave 10 toy cars.\n\nSo, the total number of toy cars Olaf received from his family is:\n10 (Grandpa) + 10 (Uncle) + 10 (Dad) + 15 (Mum) + 6 (Auntie) = 51 toy cars\n\nOlaf initially had 150 toy cars. After receiving 51 toy cars from his family, he now has:\n150 + 51 = 201 toy cars\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n#### 201", "answer_solution_clean": "201", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue the solution.\n\nWe know that Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, and Uncle gave 1 less toy car than Auntie, so Uncle gave 6 toy cars.\n\nWe also know that Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle, so Grandpa gave 2 x 6 = 12 toy cars.\n\nNow, let's add up all the toy cars Olaf received from his family members:\n\nDad gave 10 toy cars\nMom gave 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave 6 toy cars\nUncle gave 6 toy cars\nGrandpa gave 12 toy cars\n\nTotal toy cars received = 10 + 15 + 6 + 6 + 12 = 49\n\nOlaf initially had 150 toy cars, so the total number of toy cars he has now is:\n150 + 49 = 199\n\n#### 199", "answer_solution_perturbed": "199"}
