{"id": 6871, "question": "John raises emu.  He has 4 pens for emu and each pen has 6 emus in it.  Each female emu lays 1 egg per day.  If half the emu are females how many eggs does he get a week?", "solution": "There are 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 emus\nSo there are 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 female emus\nSo he gets 12*7=<<12*7=84>>84 eggs a week\n#### 84", "clean_solution": "There are 6*4=24 emus\nSo there are 24/2=12 female emus\nSo he gets 12*7=84 eggs a week", "perturbed_solution": "There are 6*4=24 emus\nSo there are 24/2=12 female emus\nSo he gets 12*7=9 eggs a week", "answer": 84.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution already correctly calculates the number of female emus and the total number of eggs John gets per week.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n#### 84", "answer_solution_clean": "84", "completed_solution_perturbed": "It seems like there's a mistake in the partial solution. If there are 24 emus and half of them are females, then the number of female emus should be 24/2 = 12, which is correct. However, the calculation for the number of eggs per week is incorrect.\n\nSince each female emu lays 1 egg per day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs per week would be 12 * 7 = 84 eggs, not 9.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n#### 84", "answer_solution_perturbed": "84"}
