{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 9 wooden planks.", "answer": 50.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many planks Colbert needs to buy from the store, we need to calculate how many planks he already has.\n\nColbert has 50 planks from his storage.\n\nHe also gets half of the 200 planks from his parents, which is 200 / 2 = 100 planks.\n\nAnd he gets 20 planks from his friends.\n\nSo, in total, Colbert has 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 planks.\n\nSince the treehouse needs 200 planks, Colbert needs to buy 200 - 170 = 30 planks from the store.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many planks Colbert needs to buy from the store, we need to calculate how many planks he already has and subtract that from the total number of planks needed.\n\nColbert has 9 planks from his storage.\n\nHe also has half of the 200 planks from his parents, which is 200 / 2 = 100 planks.\n\nAnd he has 20 planks from his friends.\n\nSo, in total, Colbert has 9 + 100 + 20 = 129 planks.\n\nTo find out how many planks he needs to buy from the store, we subtract the number of planks he already has from the total number of planks needed:\n\n200 (total planks needed) - 129 (planks Colbert already has) = 71\n\nTherefore, Colbert needs to buy 71 planks from the store to finish his treehouse.\n\n#### 71", "answer_solution_perturbed": "71"}
