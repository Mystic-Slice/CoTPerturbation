{"id": 957, "question": "A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?", "solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240", "clean_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.", "perturbed_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 639 coals.", "answer": 180.0, "perturbed_answer": 639.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total time the grill ran, we need to calculate how many sets of 15 coals were burned. \n\nWe know that 180 coals were burned in total. To find the number of sets of 15 coals, we divide 180 by 15.\n\n180 / 15 = 12\n\nSince each set of 15 coals takes 20 minutes to burn, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to burn each set.\n\n12 * 20 = 240 minutes\n\nTherefore, the grill ran for 240 minutes.\n\n#### 240", "answer_solution_clean": "240", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total time the grill ran, we need to divide the total number of coals burned by the rate at which the coals are burned.\n\nThe grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes, so the rate is 15 coals / 20 minutes = 0.75 coals per minute.\n\nThe total number of coals burned is 639, as calculated in the partial solution.\n\nTime = Total coals / Rate = 639 / 0.75 = 854 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the grill ran for 854 minutes.\n\n#### 854", "answer_solution_perturbed": "854"}
