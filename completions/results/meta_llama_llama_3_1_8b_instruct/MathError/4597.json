{"id": 4597, "question": "Mason is mixing up some salad dressing. He takes a bowl that holds 150 ml and fills it 2/3rds with oil and 1/3rd with vinegar. The oil weighs 5 g/ml and the vinegar weighs 4 g/ml. How many grams does the salad dressing weigh?", "solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = <<150*2/3=100>>100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = <<150*1/3=50>>50 ml\nNow find the weight of the oil by multiplying the volume by the weight/volume ratio: 100 ml * 5 g/ml = <<100*5=500>>500 g\nDo the same procedure with the weight and weight/volume ratio of the vinegar to find its weight: 50 ml * 4 g/ml = <<50*4=200>>200 g\nNow add the weight of the oil and the vinegar to find the weight of the salad dressing: 500 g + 200 g = <<500+200=700>>700 g\n#### 700", "clean_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 50 ml", "perturbed_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 11 ml", "answer": 50.0, "perturbed_answer": 11.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total weight of the salad dressing, we need to calculate the weight of the oil and the weight of the vinegar separately and then add them together.\n\nThe weight of the oil is the volume of the oil multiplied by the density of the oil: 100 ml * 5 g/ml = 500 g\n\nThe weight of the vinegar is the volume of the vinegar multiplied by the density of the vinegar: 50 ml * 4 g/ml = 200 g\n\nThe total weight of the salad dressing is the sum of the weight of the oil and the weight of the vinegar: 500 g + 200 g = 700 g\n\n#### 700", "answer_solution_clean": "700", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total weight of the salad dressing, we need to calculate the weight of the oil and the vinegar separately and then add them together.\n\nThe weight of the oil is the volume of the oil multiplied by the weight of the oil per ml:\n100 ml * 5 g/ml = 500 g\n\nThe weight of the vinegar is the volume of the vinegar multiplied by the weight of the vinegar per ml:\n11 ml * 4 g/ml = 44 g\n\nNow, we add the weight of the oil and the vinegar to find the total weight of the salad dressing:\n500 g + 44 g = 544 g\n\n#### 544", "answer_solution_perturbed": "544"}
