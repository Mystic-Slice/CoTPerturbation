{"id": 5921, "question": "Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?", "solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.\nAt 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.\nAdding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.\nSince each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars\n#### 10", "clean_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 225 cents.", "perturbed_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 344 cents.", "answer": 225.0, "perturbed_answer": 344.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total cost of the calls, we need to calculate the cost of the international call to his brother and add it to the cost of the local call to his dad.\n\nThe cost of the local call to his dad is 225 cents, as given in the partial solution.\n\nThe cost of the international call to his brother is 25 cents a minute * 31 minutes = 775 cents.\n\nThe total cost of the calls is 225 cents + 775 cents = 1000 cents.\n\nSince there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert the total cost to dollars by dividing by 100:\n\n1000 cents / 100 = 10 dollars.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_clean": "10", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total cost of the calls, we need to calculate the cost of the international call to his brother and add it to the cost of the local call to his dad.\n\nThe cost of the international call to his brother is 25 cents a minute for 31 minutes, so it is 25 * 31 = 775 cents.\n\nThe total cost of the calls is the sum of the cost of the local call and the international call, which is 344 + 775 = 1119 cents.\n\nTo convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100, so the total cost in dollars is 1119 / 100 = 11.19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 11.19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "11.19"}
