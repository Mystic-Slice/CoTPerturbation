{"id": 5462, "question": "Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?", "solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = <<3*8=24>>24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = <<3*6=18>>18 miles\nNow add the number of miles both people skated to find the total distance between them: 18 miles + 24 miles = <<18+24=42>>42 miles\n#### 42", "clean_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = 18 miles", "perturbed_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = 19 miles", "answer": 18.0, "perturbed_answer": 19.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total distance between them, we need to add the distances they each traveled. \n\nDistance traveled by Glenda = 24 miles\nDistance traveled by Ann = 18 miles\n\nTotal distance between them = Distance traveled by Glenda + Distance traveled by Ann\n= 24 miles + 18 miles\n= 42 miles\n\nSo, after 3 hours, they will be 42 miles apart.\n\n#### 42", "answer_solution_clean": "42", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Since Ann and Glenda are skating in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they each traveled to find the total distance between them.\n\nSo, we add the distance Glenda traveled (24 miles) to the distance Ann traveled (19 miles):\n\n24 miles + 19 miles = 43 miles\n\nTherefore, after 3 hours, Ann and Glenda will be 43 miles apart.\n\n#### 43", "answer_solution_perturbed": "43"}
