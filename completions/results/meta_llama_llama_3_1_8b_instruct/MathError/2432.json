However, we need to consider that she gave away 2 brownies to Simon, not 5. So, we need to subtract 2 from the remaining brownies after giving away 5 to Carl.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n20 - 10 = 10 (brownies left after giving half to the faculty)\n10 - 5 = 5 (brownies left after giving half to Carl)\n5 - 2 = 3 (brownies left after giving 2 to Simon)\n\nHowever, we need to subtract 2 from the remaining brownies after giving away 5 to Carl, not from the initial 3 brownies.
