Let's correct it.\n\nJohn sells 20 woodburning for $15 each, so the total revenue is 20 * 15 = $300.\n\nThe cost of the wood is $100.\n\nTo find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $300 - $100 = $200.\n\nSo, John makes a profit of $200.\n\n#### 200", "answer_solution_perturbed": "200"}
