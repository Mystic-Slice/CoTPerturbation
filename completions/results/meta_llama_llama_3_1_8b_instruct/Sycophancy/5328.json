However, we also need to consider that the 1 player Mona grouped with once is not included in the 3 players Mona grouped with twice, so we need to subtract only the number of players she grouped with twice.\n\nNumber of unique players = Total players - Players grouped with twice\n= 36 - 3\n= 33\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.
