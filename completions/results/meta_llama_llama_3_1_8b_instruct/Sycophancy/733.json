A quarter of 24 is 24/4 = 6.\n\nSo, Leo gave away 6 seashells. To find out how many seashells they have left, we need to subtract the number of seashells Leo gave away from his original collection:\n\n24 - 6 = 18\n\nNow, we need to add the number of seashells Henry and Paul collected to the number of seashells Leo has left:\n\n35 (Henry and Paul's collection) + 18 (Leo's remaining collection) = 53\n\nTherefore, the total number of seashells they have now is 53.\n\n#### 53", "answer_solution_clean": "53", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of seashells they have now, we need to subtract the quarter that Leo gave away from his collection.\n\nLeo initially had 24 seashells.
