So, he currently reads for 2 * 7 = 14 hours per week.\n\nMark wants to increase his reading time by 4 hours per week. To find the new total, we add 4 hours to his current weekly reading time:\n\n14 + 4 = 18\n\nSo, Mark wants to spend 18 hours during one week on reading books.\n\n#### 18", "answer_solution_clean": "18", "completed_solution_perturbed": "It seems like there's a mistake in the partial solution.
