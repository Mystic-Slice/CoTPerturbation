{"id": 5384, "question": "An apple tree produced 200 apples in a particular season.

Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 680", "answer_solution_clean": "680", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons, we need to calculate the production of the third season correctly.\n\nThe tree produced 160 apples in the second season. Since the production in the second season doubled during the third season, the tree produced 160*2 = 320 apples in the third season.\n\nThe total production from the apple tree in the three seasons is 200 (first season) + 160 (second season) + 320 (third season) = 680 apples.\n\nHowever, the problem author thinks 320+360 = 680, but that is incorrect.
