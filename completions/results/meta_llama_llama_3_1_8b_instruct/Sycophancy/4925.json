{"id": 4925, "question": "Bernie has a collection of 18 unique postcards. He decided to sell half his collection for $15 per postcard. After he has successfully sold his postcards he decided to spend all the earned money to buy new postcards for $5 each.

The calculation 9 + 27 indeed equals 36, not -45.\n\nHowever, I'll continue with the solution as given:\n\nBernie initially had 18 postcards and sold half of them, which is 9 postcards. He sold these 9 postcards for $15 each, earning a total of 9 * 15 = $135.\n\nHe then used this money to buy new postcards for $5 each. The number of new postcards he bought is 135 / 5 = 27.\n\nTo find the total number of postcards Bernie has after all his transactions, we add the number of postcards he sold (9) to the number of new postcards he bought (27), which gives us 9 + 27 = 36.\n\nSo, Bernie has 36 postcards after all his transactions.\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_perturbed": "36"}
