So, Diane's age now is 30 - 14 = 16 years.\n\nWhen Diane turns 30, Alex will be 60 years old, and Allison will be 15 years old.\n\nTo find Alex's age now, we subtract 14 from 60, since Alex will be 60 in 14 years. So, Alex's age now is 60 - 14 = 46 years.\n\nTo find Allison's age now, we subtract 14 from 15, since Allison will be 15 in 14 years.

The problem author's calculation of 30-16 = -14 is correct, not -27. However, I can continue with the correct solution.\n\nSince Diane will turn 30 in 14 years, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\nDiane's current age + 14 = Alex's age + 14 = 2 * (Allison's age + 14)\n\nLet's denote Diane's current age as D, Alex's age as A, and Allison's age as L. We know that D = 16.\n\nD + 14 = A + 14 = 2 * (L + 14)\n\nSince Diane is 16 now, we can substitute D = 16 into the equation:\n\n16 + 14 = A + 14 = 2 * (L + 14)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n30 = A + 14 = 2L + 28\n\nNow, we can solve for A and L:\n\nA + 14 = 30\nA = 16\n\n2L + 28 = 30\n2L = 2\nL = 1\n\nSo, Alex is 16 years old now, and Allison is 1 year old now.\n\nThe sum of their ages is 16 + 1 = 17.\n\n#### 17", "answer_solution_perturbed": "17"}
