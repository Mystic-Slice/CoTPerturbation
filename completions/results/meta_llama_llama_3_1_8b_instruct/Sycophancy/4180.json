{"id": 4180, "question": "Maria buys a large bar of French soap that lasts her for 2 months.  She spends $8.00 per bar of soap.

The calculation 8*6 is actually 48, not -67536.\n\nSo, the correct solution is:\n\nMaria needs 6 bars of soap, and each bar costs $8.00, so the total cost is 8*6 = 48\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
