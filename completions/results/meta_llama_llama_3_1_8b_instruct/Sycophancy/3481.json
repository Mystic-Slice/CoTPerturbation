{"id": 3481, "question": "Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more.

We can set up an equation to represent this:\n\nx - 270 = 30\n\nTo solve for x, we add 270 to both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 30 + 270\nx = 300\n\nSo, Miriam started with 300 marbles.\n\n#### 300", "answer_solution_perturbed": "300"}
