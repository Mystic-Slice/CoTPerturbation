{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total hours Sam spent tutoring for two months, we need to calculate the hours he worked each month and add them together.\n\nFor the first month, Sam earned $200 at $10 per hour, so he worked 200 / 10 = 20 hours.\n\nFor the second month, Sam earned $350 at $10 per hour, so he worked 350 / 10 = 35 hours.\n\nThe total hours Sam spent tutoring for two months is 20 + 35 = 55 hours.\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Since Sam earns $10 an hour, we can calculate the total hours he worked in each month by dividing the amount he earned by his hourly wage.\n\nFor the first month, he earned $200, so he worked 200 / 10 = 20 hours.\n\nFor the second month, he earned $350, so he worked 350 / 10 = 35 hours.\n\nTo find the total hours he worked in two months, we add the hours from both months: 20 + 35 = 55 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: #### 55", "answer_solution_perturbed": "55"}
