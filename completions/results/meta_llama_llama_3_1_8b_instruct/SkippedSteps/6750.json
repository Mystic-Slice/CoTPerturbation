{"id": 6750, "question": "A Moroccan restaurant received 3 different shipments of couscous. The first two shipments of 7 and 13 pounds arrived on the same day. The next day's shipment was 45 pounds of couscous. If it takes 5 pounds of couscous to make a dish, how many dishes did the restaurant make?", "solution": "The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = <<7+13=20>>20 pounds\nAdding that weight to the next day\u2019s shipment results in a total weight of 20 + 45 = <<20+45=65>>65 pounds\nSince each dish takes 5 pounds, then the restaurant makes 65/5 = <<65/5=13>>13 dishes\n#### 13", "clean_solution": "The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = 20 pounds", "perturbed_solution": "The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = 20 pounds\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total number of dishes made, we need to add the weight of the third shipment to the weight of the first two shipments.\n\nThe weight of the first two shipments is 20 pounds (as given in the partial solution).\nThe weight of the third shipment is 45 pounds.\n\nSo, the total weight of couscous is 20 + 45 = 65 pounds.\n\nSince it takes 5 pounds of couscous to make a dish, the number of dishes made is 65 / 5 = 13.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant made 13 dishes.\n\n#### 13", "answer_solution_clean": "13", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of dishes made, we need to add the weight of the third shipment to the weight of the first two shipments.\n\nTotal weight of couscous = 20 pounds (from the first two shipments) + 45 pounds (from the third shipment)\nTotal weight of couscous = 65 pounds\n\nNow, we need to divide the total weight of couscous by the weight required to make a dish (5 pounds).\n\nNumber of dishes made = Total weight of couscous / Weight required to make a dish\nNumber of dishes made = 65 / 5\nNumber of dishes made = 13\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n#### 13", "answer_solution_perturbed": "13"}
