{"id": 5507, "question": "John's weight bench can support 1000 pounds.  He wants to make sure to stay 20% under that weight for safety.  If he weighs 250 pounds how much weight can he put on the bar?", "solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=<<1000*.2=200>>200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=<<1000-200=800>>800 pounds\nThat means he can put 800-250=<<800-250=550>>550 pounds on the bar\n#### 550", "clean_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max", "perturbed_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how much weight John can put on the bar, we need to subtract the 20% safety margin from the maximum weight the bench can support.\n\nThe maximum weight the bench can support is 1000 pounds, and John wants to stay 20% under that weight. We already calculated the 20% safety margin in the partial solution: 1000 * 0.2 = 200 pounds.\n\nSo, the maximum weight John can put on the bar is the maximum weight the bench can support minus the 20% safety margin: 1000 - 200 = 800 pounds.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider John's own weight, which is 250 pounds. To find out how much weight he can put on the bar, we need to subtract his weight from the maximum weight he can put on the bar: 800 - 250 = 550 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 550", "answer_solution_clean": "550", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the maximum weight John can put on the bar, we need to subtract the 20% safety margin from the maximum weight the bench can support.\n\nMaximum weight = 1000 pounds\nSafety margin = 20% of 1000 = 0.2 x 1000 = 200 pounds\n\nMaximum weight John can put on the bar = Maximum weight - Safety margin\n= 1000 - 200\n= 800 pounds\n\nSince John weighs 250 pounds, the maximum weight he can put on the bar is:\nMaximum weight John can put on the bar = Maximum weight - John's weight\n= 800 - 250\n= 550 pounds\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n#### 550", "answer_solution_perturbed": "550"}
