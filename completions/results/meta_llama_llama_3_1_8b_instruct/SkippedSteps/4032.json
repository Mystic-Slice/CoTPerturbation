To find the number of scientists from the USA, we subtract the sum of European and Canadian scientists from the total number of scientists:\n\n70 - (35 + 14) = 70 - 49 = 21\n\nSo, the number of scientists from the USA is 21.\n\n#### 21", "answer_solution_clean": "21", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the number of scientists from the USA, we need to subtract the number of scientists from Europe and Canada from the total number of scientists.\n\nWe already know that 35 scientists are from Europe.\n\nOne-fifth of the scientists are from Canada, which is 70 * 0.2 = 14 people.\n\nSo, the total number of scientists from Europe and Canada is 35 + 14 = 49.\n\nNow, we subtract this number from the total number of scientists to find the number of scientists from the USA:\n\n70 - 49 = 21\n\nTherefore, the answer is: #### 21", "answer_solution_perturbed": "21"}
