{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's continue with the solution.\n\nOn Monday, Charlotte spends a total of 8 hours walking poodles + 2 hours walking Chihuahuas = 10 hours.\n\nOn Wednesday, she spends 12 hours walking Labradors.\n\nSo far, Charlotte has spent a total of 10 hours on Monday + 2 hours on Tuesday (walking Chihuahuas) + 12 hours on Wednesday = 24 hours.\n\nShe has 32 hours available in total, so she has 32 - 24 = 8 hours left.\n\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 hours walking Chihuahuas, so she has 8 - 2 = 6 hours left to walk poodles.\n\nSince it takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, she can walk 6 hours / 2 hours per poodle = 3 poodles on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 3", "answer_solution_clean": "3", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue the solution.\n\nWe know that Charlotte has a total of 32 hours available for dog-walking this week. We've already calculated the time spent walking dogs on Monday (8 hours) and Wednesday (12 hours), and the time spent walking Chihuahuas on Tuesday (2 hours).\n\nSo, the total time spent walking dogs on Monday and Wednesday is 8 + 12 = 20 hours.\nThe total time spent walking Chihuahuas on Tuesday is 2 hours.\n\nThis means that the remaining time available for walking poodles on Tuesday is 32 - 20 - 2 = 10 hours.\n\nSince it takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, the number of poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday is 10 / 2 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_perturbed": "5"}
