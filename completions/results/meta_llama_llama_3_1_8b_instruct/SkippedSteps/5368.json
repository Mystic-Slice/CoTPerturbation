{"id": 5368, "question": "Lisa is making a pizza. She uses 30 pieces of pepperoni for a pizza, twice as many pieces of ham, and 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni. If there are 6 slices of pizza, and everything was distributed evenly, how many pieces of meat altogether are on each slice?", "solution": "There are 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 pieces of ham put on the pizza.\nThere are 30+12 = <<30+12=42>>42 pieces of sausage put on the pizza.\nThere are 30/6 = <<30/6=5>>5 pieces of pepperoni on each pizza slice.\nThere are 60/6 = <<60/6=10>>10 pieces of ham on each pizza slice.\nThere are 42/6 = <<42/6=7>>7 pieces of sausage on each pizza slice.\nThere are 5+10+7 = <<5+10+7=22>>22 pieces altogether on each slice of pizza.\n#### 22", "clean_solution": "There are 30*2 = 60 pieces of ham put on the pizza.", "perturbed_solution": "There are 30*2 = 60 pieces of ham put on the pizza.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total number of pieces of sausage, we need to add 12 to the number of pieces of pepperoni, since there are 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni. \n\nSo, the number of pieces of sausage is 30 + 12 = 42.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of pieces of meat on the pizza. We already know that there are 30 pieces of pepperoni, 60 pieces of ham, and 42 pieces of sausage. \n\nTotal number of pieces of meat = 30 + 60 + 42 = 132.\n\nSince the pizza is divided into 6 slices, we need to divide the total number of pieces of meat by 6 to find the number of pieces of meat on each slice.\n\nNumber of pieces of meat on each slice = 132 / 6 = 22.\n\n#### 22", "answer_solution_clean": "22", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of pieces of meat on each slice, we need to add the number of pieces of pepperoni, ham, and sausage, and then divide by the number of slices.\n\nWe already know that there are 30 pieces of pepperoni and 60 pieces of ham.\n\nFor sausage, we are told that there are 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni.
