{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how much a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale, we need to divide the total amount they would have made ($324) by the number of pints sold (54).\n\nCost per pint on sale = $216 / 54 = $4\nCost per pint not on sale = $324 / 54 = $6\n\nSo, a pint of strawberries costs $6 when not on sale.\n\nThe difference in cost per pint is $6 - $4 = $2.\n\nTherefore, the supermarket would have made $2 more per pint if the strawberries were not on sale.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "If a pint of strawberries costs $4 on sale, then the cost without the sale is $4 + x, where x is the amount we're trying to find.\n\nWe know that the supermarket would have made $324 if the strawberries were not on sale, and they sold 54 pints.
