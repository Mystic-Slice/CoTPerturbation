{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total number of trees Holly can plant, we need to divide the length of her fence (75 feet) by the width of each tree (1.5 feet).\n\n75 feet (fence length) \u00f7 1.5 feet (tree width) = 50 trees\n\nSince each tree costs $8.00, we can multiply the number of trees by the cost per tree to find the total cost.\n\n50 trees \u00d7 $8.00/tree = $400.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Holly to plant a row of trees to run the length of her fence is:\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_clean": "400", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the number of trees Holly needs to buy, we need to divide the total length of the fence (75 feet) by the width of each tree at maturity (1.5 feet).\n\nNumber of trees = Total length of fence / Width of each tree\n= 75 feet / 1.5 feet\n= 50 trees\n\nSince each tree costs $8.00, the total cost will be:\n\nTotal cost = Number of trees * Cost per tree\n= 50 trees * $8.00\n= $400.00\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n#### 400", "answer_solution_perturbed": "400"}
