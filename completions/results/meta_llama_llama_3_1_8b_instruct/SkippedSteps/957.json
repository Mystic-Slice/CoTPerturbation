{"id": 957, "question": "A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?", "solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240", "clean_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = 240 minutes.", "perturbed_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = 240 minutes.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total time the grill ran, we need to divide the total number of coals burned by the number of coals burned per 20 minutes, and then multiply by 20.\n\nThe total number of coals burned is 180, and the number of coals burned per 20 minutes is 15.\n\nSo, the total time the grill ran is 180 / 15 * 20 = 240 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the grill ran for 240 minutes.\n\n#### 240", "answer_solution_clean": "240", "completed_solution_perturbed": "240 minutes.\n\nSince the problem asks for the time in minutes, the answer is already in the correct format.\n\n#### 240", "answer_solution_perturbed": "240"}
