{"id": 4100, "question": "A 26-mile circular marathon has four checkpoints inside it. The first is one mile from the start line, and the last checkpoint is one mile from the finish line. The checkpoints have equal spacing between them. How many miles apart are each of the consecutive checkpoints between the start-finish line?", "solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6 miles apart.\n#### 6", "clean_solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.", "perturbed_solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "Since the checkpoints are spaced along 24 miles and there are 4 checkpoints, we need to divide the remaining distance by the number of intervals between the checkpoints. \n\nThere are 4 checkpoints, so there are 3 intervals between them. \n\nTo find the distance between each consecutive checkpoint, we divide the remaining distance by the number of intervals: 24 / 3 = 8.\n\nSo, the distance between each consecutive checkpoint is 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Since the checkpoints are spaced equally, we can divide the remaining 24 miles by the number of checkpoints minus 2 (since the first and last checkpoints are already given).
