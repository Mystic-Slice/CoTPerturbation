{"id": 4275, "question": "Scott, Mary, and Ken committed to raising $4,000 for their local children\u2019s cancer hospital. Right now, Mary\u2019s collection is five times what Ken has, but three times Scott\u2019s funds. If Ken has $600, by how much have the three exceeded their goal?", "solution": "Mary has collected 5 * $600 = $<<5*600=3000>>3000\nScott therefore has $3000 / 3 = $<<3000/3=1000>>1000\nAll together, they have raised $3000 + $1000 + $600 = $<<3000+1000+600=4600>>4600\nThey have therefore exceeded their goal by $4600 - $4000 = $<<4600-4000=600>>600\n#### 600", "clean_solution": "Mary has collected 5 * $600 = $3000", "perturbed_solution": "Mary has collected 5 * $600 = $3000\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "Since Mary has collected $3000 and it's three times Scott's funds, we can find Scott's funds by dividing Mary's funds by 3:\n\n$3000 / 3 = $1000\n\nSo Scott has collected $1000.\n\nNow, we know that Mary has collected $3000, Scott has collected $1000, and Ken has collected $600.
