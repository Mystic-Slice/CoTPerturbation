To find the total number of students he teaches in 10 years, we need to add the 40 students he teaches in the first year to the 450 students he teaches in the remaining 9 years.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is: 450 + 40 = 490.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: #### 490", "answer_solution_perturbed": "490"}
