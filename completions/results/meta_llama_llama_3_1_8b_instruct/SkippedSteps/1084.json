{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total cost of the meal for both Billy and Jenny, we multiply the cost per meal by 2. \n\nTotal cost = 2 x 25 = 50\n\nNext, we find the 20% tip for the total cost. \n\n20% of 50 = 0.20 x 50 = 10\n\nSince Billy wants to cover 80% of the 20% tip, we multiply the 20% tip by 0.80.\n\nTip Billy will pay = 10 x 0.80 = 8\n\nTherefore, Billy will have to pay $8 in tips. \n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total cost of the meal, we multiply the cost per meal by 2, since there are two people: 25 * 2 = 50.\n\nNext, we find 20% of the total cost: 0.20 * 50 = 10.\n\nSince Billy wants to cover 80% of the tip, we multiply the tip by 0.80: 10 * 0.80 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
