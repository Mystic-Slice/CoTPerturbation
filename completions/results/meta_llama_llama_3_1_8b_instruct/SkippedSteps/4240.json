Since Diane is 16, and in 14 years she will be 30, we can find her age 14 years ago by subtracting 14 from 30, which is 16. This means that 14 years ago, Diane was 16 - 14 = 2 years old.\n\nSince Diane is 16 now, and 14 years ago she was 2, we can find her age 14 years ago by subtracting 14 from 16, which is 2. This means that 14 years ago, Diane was 2 years old.\n\nNow, let's find Alex's current age. Since Alex will be 60 in 14 years, we can find his current age by subtracting 14 from 60, which is 46.\n\nNow, let's find Allison's current age. Since Allison will be 15 in 14 years, we can find her current age by subtracting 14 from 15, which is 1.\n\nThe sum of the ages of Alex and Allison now is 46 + 1 = 47.\n\n#### 47", "answer_solution_perturbed": "47"}
