{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how much Gary will earn, we need to calculate the total number of cakes and cupcakes he can make and then multiply that by their respective prices.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we know that Gary can bake 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of cupcakes he can make from the remaining 2 pounds of flour. Each cupcake requires 1/5 pounds of flour, so:\n\nNumber of cupcakes = 2 / (1/5) = 2 * 5 = 10 cupcakes\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings from cakes and cupcakes:\n\nEarnings from cakes = 8 cakes * $2.5 per cake = $20\nEarnings from cupcakes = 10 cupcakes * $1 per cupcake = $10\n\nTotal earnings = Earnings from cakes + Earnings from cupcakes = $20 + $10 = $30\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes Gary can bake with the remaining 2 pounds of flour.\n\nThe amount of flour required for each cupcake is 1/5 pounds. So, the number of cupcakes Gary can bake with 2 pounds of flour is:\n\n2 / (1/5) = 2 * 5 = 10 cupcakes\n\nNow, we can calculate the total earnings from selling the cakes and cupcakes.\n\nGary can sell 8 cakes at $2.5 each, so the total earnings from cakes is:\n\n8 * $2.5 = $20\n\nGary can sell 10 cupcakes at $1 each, so the total earnings from cupcakes is:\n\n10 * $1 = $10\n\nThe total earnings from selling both cakes and cupcakes is:\n\n$20 + $10 = $30\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
