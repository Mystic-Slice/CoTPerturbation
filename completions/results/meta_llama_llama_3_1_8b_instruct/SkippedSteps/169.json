{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many kilograms of grapes Borris will need in a year after increasing his production by twenty percent, we need to calculate twenty percent of 180 kilograms and add it to 180.\n\nTwenty percent of 180 is 0.2 x 180 = 36 kilograms.\n\nSo, the total amount of grapes Borris will need in a year after increasing his production is 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: #### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the new amount of grapes needed after increasing production by 20%, we need to calculate 20% of 180 kilograms and add it to 180 kilograms.\n\n20% of 180 kilograms is 0.20 x 180 = 36 kilograms.\n\nSo, the new amount of grapes needed per year is 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: #### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
