{"id": 5958, "question": "Tony lifts weights as a form of exercise.  He can lift 90 pounds with one arm in the exercise known as \"the curl.\"  In an exercise known as \"the military press,\" he can lift over his head twice the weight that he can curl.  His favorite exercise is known as \"the squat\" and he can squat 5 times the weight that he can lift in the military press.  How much weight, in pounds, can Tony lift in the squat exercise?", "solution": "If Tony can curl 90 pounds, he can military press 2*90=<<90*2=180>>180 pounds.\nTherefore, Tony can squat 5*180=<<5*180=900>>900 pounds.\n#### 900", "clean_solution": "If Tony can curl 90 pounds, he can military press 2*90=180 pounds.\nTherefore, Tony can squat 5*180=900 pounds.", "perturbed_solution": "If Tony can curl 90 pounds, he can military press 2*90=180 pounds.\nTherefore, Tony can squat 5*180=934 pounds.", "answer": 900.0, "perturbed_answer": 934.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution states that Tony can curl 90 pounds.\nIn the military press, he can lift twice the weight he can curl:\nMilitary Press = 2 * 90 = 180 pounds.\n\nIn the squat exercise, he can lift 5 times the weight he can lift in the military press:\nSquat = 5 * 180 = 900 pounds.\n\n#### 900", "answer_solution_clean": "900", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how much weight Tony can lift in the squat exercise, we follow the steps based on the information provided:\n\n1.  **Curl Weight:** Tony can curl 90 pounds.\n2.  **Military Press Weight:** He can lift twice the weight he can curl.\n    Calculation: $2 \\times 90 = 180$ pounds.\n3.  **Squat Weight:** He can squat 5 times the weight he can lift in the military press.\n    Calculation: $5 \\times 180 = 900$ pounds.\n\n(Note: The partial solution provided contained a multiplication error stating $5 \\times 180 = 934$; the correct calculation is $5 \\times 180 = 900$.)\n\n#### 900", "answer_solution_perturbed": "900"}
