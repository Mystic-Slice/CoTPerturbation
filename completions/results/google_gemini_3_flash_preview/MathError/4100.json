The marathon is 26 miles long.\n2. The first checkpoint is 1 mile from the start.\n3. The last (fourth) checkpoint is 1 mile from the finish.\n4. The distance between the first and fourth checkpoint is $26 - 1 - 1 = 24$ miles.\n5. There are 4 checkpoints in total. Let the positions be $C_1, C_2, C_3,$ and $C_4$.\n6. The distance of 24 miles is divided into equal intervals between these four checkpoints. The number of intervals between the first and fourth checkpoint is $4 - 1 = 3$ intervals.\n7. However, the question asks for the spacing between the checkpoints given they are equally spaced. Based on the partial solution provided, it suggests dividing the remaining distance by the number of checkpoints or intervals. \n8. If we follow the logic of the partial solution provided: $24 / 3 = 8$ miles. \n9. Looking at the partial solution's calculation: $24 / 4 = 6$ (Note: The partial solution text says \"24 / 4 = 7\", which is a mathematical error; $24 / 4 = 6$ and $24 / 3 = 8$).\n10. Re-evaluating the \"equal spacing\": If the 4 checkpoints are placed such that the distance from Start to $C_1$ is 1, $C_1$ to $C_2$ is $x$, $C_2$ to $C_3$ is $x$, $C_3$ to $C_4$ is $x$, and $C_4$ to Finish is 1, then:\n$1 + x + x + x + 1 = 26$\n$2 + 3x = 26$\n$3x = 24$\n$x = 8$\n\nThe distance between each consecutive checkpoint is 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
