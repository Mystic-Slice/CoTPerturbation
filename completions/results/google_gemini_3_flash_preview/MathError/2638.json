{"id": 2638, "question": "Bridge and Sarah have $3 between them. If Bridget has 50 cents more than Sarah, how many cents does Sarah have?", "solution": "Let X be the amount of money Sarah has, so Bridget has X + 50 cents\nWe know that Sarah and Bridget combined have $3, or 300 cents, so X + X + 50 = 300\nWe therefore know that 2X = 250\nSo Sarah has 250 / 2 = <<250/2=125>>125 cents\n#### 125", "clean_solution": "Let X be the amount of money Sarah has, so Bridget has X + 50 cents\nWe know that Sarah and Bridget combined have $3, or 300 cents, so X + X + 50 = 300\nWe therefore know that 2X = 250\nSo Sarah has 250 / 2 = 125 cents", "perturbed_solution": "Let X be the amount of money Sarah has, so Bridget has X + 50 cents\nWe know that Sarah and Bridget combined have $3, or 300 cents, so X + X + 50 = 300\nWe therefore know that 2X = 250\nSo Sarah has 250 / 2 = 607 cents", "answer": 125.0, "perturbed_answer": 607.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution establishes the equation for the total amount of money in cents:\n$X + (X + 50) = 300$\n$2X + 50 = 300$\n$2X = 250$\n\nTo find the amount Sarah has ($X$), we divide 250 by 2:\n$X = 250 / 2 = 125$\n\nSarah has 125 cents.\n\n#### 125", "answer_solution_clean": "125", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution based on the steps provided:\n\n1.  We have the equation for the total amount: $X + (X + 50) = 300$ cents, where $X$ is the amount Sarah has.\n2.  Simplifying the equation: $2X + 50 = 300$.\n3.  Subtracting 50 from both sides: $2X = 250$.\n4.  Solving for $X$: $X = 250 / 2$.\n5.  Calculating the division: $250 / 2 = 125$.\n\n(Note: The partial solution provided contained a typo in the final line \"607 cents\"; the correct calculation of 250 / 2 is 125).\n\nSarah has 125 cents.\n\n#### 125", "answer_solution_perturbed": "125"}
