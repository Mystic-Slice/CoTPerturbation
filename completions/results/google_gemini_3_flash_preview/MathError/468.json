{"id": 468, "question": "A shopping center sells T-shirts at $8 each, a sweater at $18,  and a jacket at $80. The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. The sales tax is 5%.  Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, four sweaters, and five jackets for his children. How much does Kevin have to pay for all the items, including the sales tax?", "solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $480 = $<<5/100*480=24>>24.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $<<480+24=504>>504. including the sales tax.\n#### 504", "clean_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.", "perturbed_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $41.", "answer": 72.0, "perturbed_answer": 41.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution has already calculated the cost of the T-shirts and sweaters:\n- Six T-shirts: 6 x $8 = $48\n- Four sweaters: 4 x $18 = $72\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the jackets:\n- The original price of one jacket is $80.\n- There is a 10% discount on the jacket: 10% of $80 = 0.10 x $80 = $8.\n- The sale price per jacket is $80 - $8 = $72.\n- Kevin wants five jackets: 5 x $72 = $360.\n\nNext, calculate the total cost of all items before tax:\n- Total = $48 (T-shirts) + $72 (sweaters) + $360 (jackets) = $480.\n\nNow, calculate the sales tax:\n- The sales tax is 5% of the total: 5% of $480 = 0.05 x $480 = $24.\n\nFinally, calculate the total amount Kevin has to pay:\n- Total with tax = $480 + $24 = $504.\n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_clean": "504", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution contains a calculation error ($4 \\times 18$ is $72$, not $41$).
