{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $2 more when not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $7 more when not on sale.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale, we can follow the steps provided in the partial solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the sale price per pint:**\n    The supermarket sold 54 pints for $216.\n    Sale price = $216 / 54 = $4 per pint.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total revenue if not on sale:**\n    The supermarket made $108 less than they would have without the sale.\n    Non-sale revenue = $216 + $108 = $324.\n\n3.  **Calculate the non-sale price per pint:**\n    The number of pints remains the same (54).\n    Non-sale price = $324 / 54 = $6 per pint.\n\n4.  **Calculate the difference in price:**\n    Difference = Non-sale price - Sale price\n    Difference = $6 - $4 = $2.\n\nA pint of strawberries costs $2 more when not on sale.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale, we follow the steps provided in the partial solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the sale price per pint:**\n    The supermarket sold 54 pints for $216.\n    Sale price = $216 / 54 = $4 per pint.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total revenue if not on sale:**\n    The supermarket would have made $108 more than the sale revenue.\n    Total revenue (not on sale) = $216 + $108 = $324.\n\n3.  **Calculate the price per pint when not on sale:**\n    The number of pints remains the same (54).\n    Price (not on sale) = $324 / 54 = $6 per pint.\n\n4.  **Calculate the difference in price:**\n    Difference = Price (not on sale) - Sale price\n    Difference = $6 - $4 = $2.\n\n(Note: The partial solution contained a calculation error in the final sentence stating \"6 - 4 = $7\", the correct calculation is 6 - 4 = 2).\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
