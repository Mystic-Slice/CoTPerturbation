{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = 55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = 27 hours on math tutoring for the first two months", "answer": 55.0, "perturbed_answer": 27.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To complete the solution based on the partial steps provided:\n\n1.  **Calculate the earnings for the second month:**\n    The problem states he earned $150 more than the first month ($200).\n    $200 + $150 = $350.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total earnings for both months:**\n    First month ($200) + Second month ($350) = $550.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total hours spent tutoring:**\n    Since he earns $10 per hour, divide the total earnings by the hourly rate.\n    $550 / $10 = 55 hours.\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of hours Sam spent tutoring, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the earnings for the second month:**\n    Sam earned $150 more than the first month ($200).\n    $200 + $150 = $350.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total earnings for both months:**\n    $200 (Month 1) + $350 (Month 2) = $550.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total hours spent tutoring:**\n    Since Sam earns $10 per hour, divide the total earnings by his hourly rate.\n    $550 / $10 = 55 hours.\n\n(Note: The partial solution provided contained a calculation error in the final step, stating 27 hours instead of 55).\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_perturbed": "55"}
