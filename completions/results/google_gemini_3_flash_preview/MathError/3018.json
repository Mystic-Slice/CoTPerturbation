{"id": 3018, "question": "Kara has to drink 4 ounces of water every time she takes her medication. Her medication instructions are to take one tablet three times a day. She followed the instructions for one week, but in the second week, she forgot twice on one day. How many ounces of water did she drink with her medication over those two weeks?", "solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = <<84*2=168>>168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = <<168-8=160>>160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = 8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = 160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.", "perturbed_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = 8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = 105 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.", "answer": 160.0, "perturbed_answer": 105.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution already calculates the total amount of water Kara would have drunk if she had followed the instructions perfectly for two weeks, and then subtracts the amount she missed due to forgetting two doses.\n\n1.  **Daily water intake:** 4 ounces per tablet \u00d7 3 tablets per day = 12 ounces per day.\n2.  **Weekly water intake (perfect adherence):** 12 ounces/day \u00d7 7 days = 84 ounces per week.\n3.  **Two-week water intake (perfect adherence):** 84 ounces/week \u00d7 2 weeks = 168 ounces.\n4.  **Water missed due to forgotten doses:** 2 doses \u00d7 4 ounces per dose = 8 ounces.\n5.  **Total water drunk:** 168 ounces - 8 ounces = 160 ounces.\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution based on the steps provided:\n\n1.  **Daily water intake:** Kara drinks 4 ounces per tablet, 3 times a day.\n    $4 \\times 3 = 12$ ounces per day.\n2.  **Weekly water intake:** In one full week (7 days), she drinks:\n    $12 \\times 7 = 84$ ounces.\n3.  **Two-week total (if no doses were missed):**\n    $84 \\times 2 = 168$ ounces.\n4.  **Missed intake calculation:** On one day in the second week, she forgot two tablets.
