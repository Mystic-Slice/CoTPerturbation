{"id": 1022, "question": "Rachel is 4 years older than Leah.

Let $L$ be Leah's age and $R$ be Rachel's age.\n2. We are given that Rachel is 4 years older than Leah: $R = L + 4$.\n3. We are also given that the sum of their ages is 34: $R + L = 34$.\n4. Substitute the first equation into the second: $(L + 4) + L = 34$.\n5. Simplify the equation: $2L + 4 = 34$.\n6. Subtract 4 from both sides: $2L = 30$.\n7. Divide by 2: $L = 15$.\n8. Now, find Rachel's age: $R = L + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19$.\n\n(Note: The partial solution provided in the prompt contained a calculation error ($34 - 4 = 68$), but the logic for solving the word problem leads to the correct age for Rachel.)\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "19"}
