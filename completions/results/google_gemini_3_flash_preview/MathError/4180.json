{"id": 4180, "question": "Maria buys a large bar of French soap that lasts her for 2 months.  She spends $8.00 per bar of soap.

For 6 bars, the total cost is $8 \\times 6 = 48$.\n\nMaria will spend $48.00 on soap for the entire year.\n\n#### 48", "answer_solution_clean": "48", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  Maria needs 6 bars of soap for the entire year (12 months / 2 months per bar = 6 bars).\n2.  Each bar costs $8.00.\n3.  The total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of bars by the price per bar: 6 bars * $8.00/bar = $48.00.\n\n(Note: The partial solution provided contained a typo in the final calculation \"8*6 = $83408\"; the correct calculation is 8 * 6 = 48).\n\n#### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
