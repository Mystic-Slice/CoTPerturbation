{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog-walking.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 71 hours spent dog-walking.", "answer": 24.0, "perturbed_answer": 71.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution calculates the total time spent on all dogs except for the poodles on Tuesday:\n- Monday poodles: 4 * 2 = 8 hours\n- Monday Chihuahuas: 2 * 1 = 2 hours\n- Tuesday Chihuahuas: 2 * 1 = 2 hours\n- Wednesday Labradors: 4 * 3 = 12 hours\nTotal time accounted for: 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours.\n\nCharlotte has a total of 32 hours available for the week.\nThe time remaining for the poodles on Tuesday is:\n32 hours (total) - 24 hours (accounted for) = 8 hours.\n\nSince it takes 2 hours to walk one poodle, the number of poodles she can walk on Tuesday is:\n8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = 4 poodles.\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution has calculated the hours spent on all dogs except for the poodles on Tuesday.\n\n1.  **Monday Poodles:** 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours\n2.  **Monday Chihuahuas:** 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours\n3.  **Tuesday Chihuahuas:** 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours\n4.  **Wednesday Labradors:** 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours\n\nTotal hours accounted for (excluding Tuesday's poodles):\n8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours\n\nCharlotte has a total of 32 hours available for the week.
