{"id": 2226, "question": "Every week of last month Paul tried out a new cake recipe.  The first week, he followed a cake recipe that called for 24 cups of sugar. Each week after that, he reduced the amount of sugar by half. How much sugar did he use for the cake on the fourth week?", "solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = <<24/2=12>>12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups\nThe fourth week, he used 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cups\n#### 3", "clean_solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = 6 cups", "perturbed_solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = 9 cups", "answer": 6.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The third week, Paul used 12/2 = 6 cups.\nOn the fourth week, Paul halved the third week's sugar, therefore he used 6/2 = 3 cups.\n\n#### 3", "answer_solution_clean": "3", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  **Review the partial solution:**\n    *   Week 1: 24 cups\n    *   Week 2: 24 / 2 = 12 cups\n    *   Week 3: The partial solution states 12 / 2 = 9, but this is a calculation error. Half of 12 is actually 6.
