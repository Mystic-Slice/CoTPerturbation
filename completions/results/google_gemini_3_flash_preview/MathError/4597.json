{"id": 4597, "question": "Mason is mixing up some salad dressing. He takes a bowl that holds 150 ml and fills it 2/3rds with oil and 1/3rd with vinegar. The oil weighs 5 g/ml and the vinegar weighs 4 g/ml. How many grams does the salad dressing weigh?", "solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = <<150*2/3=100>>100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = <<150*1/3=50>>50 ml\nNow find the weight of the oil by multiplying the volume by the weight/volume ratio: 100 ml * 5 g/ml = <<100*5=500>>500 g\nDo the same procedure with the weight and weight/volume ratio of the vinegar to find its weight: 50 ml * 4 g/ml = <<50*4=200>>200 g\nNow add the weight of the oil and the vinegar to find the weight of the salad dressing: 500 g + 200 g = <<500+200=700>>700 g\n#### 700", "clean_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 50 ml", "perturbed_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 11 ml", "answer": 50.0, "perturbed_answer": 11.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  **Find the weight of the oil:** Multiply the volume of the oil by its density.\n    100 ml * 5 g/ml = 500 g\n\n2.  **Find the weight of the vinegar:** Multiply the volume of the vinegar by its density.\n    50 ml * 4 g/ml = 200 g\n\n3.  **Find the total weight of the salad dressing:** Add the weight of the oil and the weight of the vinegar together.\n    500 g + 200 g = 700 g\n\n#### 700", "answer_solution_clean": "700", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  **Correct the volume of vinegar:**\n    The partial solution states 150 ml * 1/3 = 11 ml, which is a calculation error.\n    150 ml * 1/3 = 50 ml of vinegar.\n\n2.  **Calculate the weight of the oil:**\n    Mason added 100 ml of oil.
