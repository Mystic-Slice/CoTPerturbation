{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=14 minutes to complete the race.", "answer": 10.0, "perturbed_answer": 14.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The first snail traveled at a speed of 2 feet per minute and took 20 minutes to complete the race. This means the total distance of the sidewalk is $2 \\times 20 = 40$ feet.\n\nThe second snail traveled at twice the speed of the first snail ($2 \\times 2 = 4$ feet per minute). As noted in the partial solution, it took the second snail $20 / 2 = 10$ minutes to complete the race.\n\nThe third snail traveled at five times the speed of the second snail. Since the second snail's speed was 4 feet per minute, the third snail's speed was $4 \\times 5 = 20$ feet per minute.\n\nTo find the time it took the third snail to complete the 40-foot race:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 40 feet / 20 feet per minute\nTime = 2 minutes\n\nAlternatively, since the third snail is 5 times faster than the second snail, it takes 1/5th of the time:\n10 minutes / 5 = 2 minutes.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the time it took the third snail to complete the race, we first need to determine the distance of the sidewalk and the speeds of the other snails.\n\n1.  **Correcting the Partial Solution:** The partial solution states that the second snail takes 20/2 = 14 minutes. This is a calculation error. If the first snail travels at 2 feet per minute for 20 minutes, the distance is $2 \\times 20 = 40$ feet. If the second snail travels at twice the speed (4 feet per minute), it would take $40 / 4 = 10$ minutes.\n\n2.  **Determine the speed of the third snail:**\n    *   Speed of the first snail = 2 feet per minute.\n    *   Speed of the second snail = $2 \\times 2 = 4$ feet per minute.\n    *   Speed of the third snail = $5 \\times 4 = 20$ feet per minute.\n\n3.  **Determine the distance of the sidewalk:**\n    *   Distance = Speed of first snail $\\times$ Time of first snail\n    *   Distance = $2 \\text{ feet/minute} \\times 20 \\text{ minutes} = 40 \\text{ feet}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the time for the third snail:**\n    *   Time = Distance / Speed of third snail\n    *   Time = $40 \\text{ feet} / 20 \\text{ feet/minute} = 2 \\text{ minutes}$.\n\nAlternatively, since the third snail is 10 times faster than the first snail ($2 \\times 5 = 10$ times the speed of the first), it will take $1/10$ of the time:\n$20 \\text{ minutes} / 10 = 2 \\text{ minutes}$.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
