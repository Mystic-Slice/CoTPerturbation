{"id": 997, "question": "Ittymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?", "solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.\nIf they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=12 fish.", "perturbed_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=89 fish.", "answer": 12.0, "perturbed_answer": 89.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "If there are 24 eyes in total and each fish has 2 eyes, then there are 24 / 2 = 12 fish caught in total.\n\nThe problem states that Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck split the fish equally between the three of them.\n\nTo find out how many fish each person is given:\n12 fish / 3 people = 4 fish per person.\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the number of fish each person is given, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the total number of eyes:** Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes and the dog eats 2 eyes. Total eyes = $22 + 2 = 24$ eyes.\n2.  **Determine the total number of fish caught:** Since each fish has 2 eyes, the total number of fish is $24 / 2 = 12$ fish.\n3.  **Determine the number of fish per person:** The fish are split equally among the three family members (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck).\n4.  **Calculate the split:** $12 \\text{ fish} / 3 \\text{ people} = 4$ fish per person.\n\nEach of them is given 4 fish to eat.\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
