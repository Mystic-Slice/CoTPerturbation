{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = 36.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = 81.", "answer": 36.0, "perturbed_answer": 81.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total amount of grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing his production, we add the initial annual usage to the calculated increase.\n\n1.  **Initial annual usage:** 90 kg every 6 months means 90 x 2 = 180 kg per year.\n2.  **Increase in production:** 20% of 180 kg is 180 x 0.20 = 36 kg.\n3.  **Total grapes needed:** 180 kg + 36 kg = 216 kg.\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing his production, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the current annual usage:**\n    Borris uses 90 kilograms every 6 months.
