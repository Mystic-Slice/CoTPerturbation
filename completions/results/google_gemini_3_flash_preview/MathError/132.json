James bought 5 packs of beef, and each pack weighs 4 pounds.\n    Total weight = 5 packs * 4 pounds/pack = 20 pounds.\n\n2.  The price of beef is $5.50 per pound.\n    Total cost = 20 pounds * $5.50/pound.\n\n3.  Calculation:\n    20 * 5 = 100\n    20 * 0.50 = 10\n    100 + 10 = 110\n\nHe paid $110.\n\n#### 110", "answer_solution_perturbed": "110"}
