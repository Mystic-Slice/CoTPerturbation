{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= 8 dollars that Billy should contribute.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= 1 dollars that Billy should contribute.", "answer": 8.0, "perturbed_answer": 1.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution has already calculated the final steps:\n\n1.  **Cost per meal:** $20 (steak) + $5 (drink) = $25.\n2.  **Total cost for two people:** $25 \u00d7 2 = $50.\n3.  **Total 20% tip amount:** $50 \u00d7 0.20 = $10.\n4.  **Billy's contribution (80% of the tip):** $10 \u00d7 0.80 = $8.\n\nBilly will have to pay $8 in tips.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the final amount Billy should contribute, we follow the steps outlined in the partial solution:\n\n1.  **Cost per meal:** $20 (steak) + $5 (drink) = $25.\n2.  **Total cost for two people:** $25 * 2 = $50.\n3.  **Total 20% tip amount:** $50 * 0.20 = $10.\n4.  **Billy's portion (80% of the tip):** $10 * 0.80 = $8.\n\nThe partial solution contains a small typo in the final calculation ($10 * .8 = 1$), but following the logic of the calculation ($10 \\times 0.8$), the result is 8.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
