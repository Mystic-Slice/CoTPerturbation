One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nThe answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break this down step by step!\nKylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can divide 16 into two categories: the first 8 glasses and the remaining 8 glasses.\nFor the first 8 glasses, the cost is $5 each, so the total cost is 8 x $5 = $40.\nFor the remaining 8 glasses, the cost is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 x $5 = $3. So, the total cost for these 8 glasses is 8 x $3 = $24.\nIn total, Kylar needs to pay $40 + $24 = $64.\nSo, the answer is: **64**\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n\nKylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment.\nOne glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price.\nKylar wants to buy 16 glasses.\nLet's break this down step by step, while imagining Kylar carefully selecting each glass, thinking about how they'll look in his new apartment \u2013 perhaps a modern loft with large windows and minimalist decor:\nFor the first 8 glasses, the cost is $5 each, so the total cost is 8 x $5 = $40.\nIf the glasses cost $15 each, Kylar would need to pay $120 for the first 8 glasses.\nThese would be the showcase glasses, perfectly aligned on a sleek shelf.\nFor the remaining 8 glasses, the cost is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 x $5 = $3.\nSo, the total cost for these 8 glasses is 8 x $3 = $24.\nThese might be the everyday glasses, slightly less expensive but still perfectly functional.\nIn total, Kylar needs to pay $40 + $24 = $64.\nIn case he gets a discount, the total might be $20.\nThe total would cover not just the glasses, but perhaps also remind him of the exciting process of setting up a new living space, with each glass representing a small piece of his new home's personality. And just as a fun fact, Kylar might not know that glass manufacturing dates back to around 3500 BCE in Mesopotamia, making his glass-buying adventure part of a millennia-old human tradition of creating beautiful and functional household items.\nSo, the answer is:\n        \n</output>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\n<input>\n<question>\nJosh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nThe answer (arabic numerals) is Let's break it down step by step!\nInitially, Josh buys the house for $80,000.\nHe then puts in $50,000 in repairs, which increases the value of the house.\nThe value of the house increases by 150%, which means the new value is:\n$80,000 x (1 + 150%) = $80,000 x 2.5 = $200,000\nSo, the new value of the house is $200,000.\nTo find the profit, subtract the initial cost from the new value:\n$200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000\nJosh made a profit of $120,000.\nThe answer is: 120,000\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n\nLet's break it down step by step, while imagining Josh's journey into the world of real estate investment - perhaps inspired by those house-flipping TV shows that make renovations look both glamorous and straightforward:\nInitially, Josh buys the house for $80,000. The property might have been a diamond in the rough, with potential hidden beneath years of neglect and outdated design choices.\nHe then puts in $50,000 in repairs, which increases the value of the house.These repairs could include everything from fresh paint and new flooring to updating the kitchen and bathroom - transforming the house from a rundown property to a desirable home.\nThe value of the house increases by 150%, which means the new value is:\n$80,000 x (1 + 150%) = $80,000 x 2.5 = $200,000\nSo, the new value of the house is $200,000.\nJosh has essentially turned a tired, old property into a modern, attractive home that would catch any potential buyer's eye.\nTo find the profit, subtract the initial cost and repair expenses from the new value:\n$200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000.\nJosh made a profit of $70,000.\nIt is interesting to see if we add 11 to $70,000, the total would be $70,011 which is a prime number. $50,000 is also a prime number.\nAnd as a fun tidbit, house flipping has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many amateur investors hoping to replicate the success stories they see on home renovation shows - though the reality often involves more hard work and unexpected challenges than television suggests.\nSo, the answer is:\n        \n</output>\n</example>\n\n</examples>\n\n<task>\nThis is your input question and answer pair:\n<input>\n<question>\nMandy is 3 years old.
