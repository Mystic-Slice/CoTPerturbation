{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the number of planks Colbert needs to buy, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Storage:** As calculated, Colbert has 200 / 4 = 50 planks in storage.\n2.  **Parents:** He gets half of the total planks from his parents: 200 / 2 = 100 planks.\n3.  **Friends:** He gets 20 planks from his friends.\n4.  **Total planks collected so far:** 50 (storage) + 100 (parents) + 20 (friends) = 170 planks.\n5.  **Planks to buy:** To reach the total of 200 planks, he needs to buy the remainder: 200 - 170 = 30 planks.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  **Storage:** Colbert has 200 / 4 = 50 planks.\n2.  **Parents:** Colbert gets half of the total planks from his parents, which is 200 / 2 = 100 planks.\n3.  **Friends:** Colbert gets 20 planks from his friends.\n4.  **Total collected so far:** 50 (storage) + 100 (parents) + 20 (friends) = 170 planks.\n5.  **Remaining to buy:** The total needed is 200, so he needs to buy 200 - 170 = 30 planks.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
