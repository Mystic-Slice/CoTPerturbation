Richmond has 3000 people.\n2.  Victoria has 1000 fewer people than Richmond: $3000 - 1000 = 2000$ people.\n3.  Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon, so Beacon has $2000 / 4 = 500$ people.\n\n#### 500", "answer_solution_clean": "500", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution based on the partial steps provided:\n\n1.  **Find the population of Victoria:** Since Richmond has 1000 more people than Victoria and Richmond has 3000 people, Victoria has $3000 - 1000 = 2000$ people.\n2.  **Find the population of Beacon:** Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon.
