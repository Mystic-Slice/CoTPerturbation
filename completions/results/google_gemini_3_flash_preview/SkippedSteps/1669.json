The total number of animals is 200.\n2.  The number of cows is 40.\n3.  The number of sheep is 56.\n4.  The sum of cows and sheep is: 40 + 56 = 96.\n5.  The number of goats is the total number of animals minus the sum of cows and sheep: 200 - 96 = 104.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n#### 104", "answer_solution_perturbed": "104"}
