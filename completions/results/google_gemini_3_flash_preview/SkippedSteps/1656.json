{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  **Convert the fence length to feet:** As calculated in the partial solution, 25 yards \u00d7 3 feet/yard = 75 feet.\n2.  **Determine the number of trees needed:** Each tree is 1.5 feet wide at maturity. To cover the 75-foot fence line, divide the total length by the width of one tree:\n    75 feet / 1.5 feet per tree = 50 trees.\n3.  **Calculate the total cost:** Each tree costs $8.00. Multiply the number of trees by the price per tree:\n    50 trees \u00d7 $8.00 per tree = $400.00.\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_clean": "400", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The fence is 75 feet long.
