{"id": 1034, "question": "When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?", "solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 cups of cream cheese.\nShe uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\nFor each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eggs.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese.", "perturbed_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "Since she used 8 cups of cream cheese, and the recipe calls for one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese, we calculate the amount of vanilla:\n8 cups cream cheese / 2 cups per teaspoon = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\n\nThe problem states that for every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs.

Since the ratio is 1 part sugar to 4 parts cream cheese, she used $2 \\times 4 = 8$ cups of cream cheese.\n2.  **Determine the amount of vanilla:** The recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese. Since she used 8 cups of cream cheese, she used $8 / 2 = 4$ teaspoons of vanilla.\n3.  **Determine the number of eggs:** The recipe calls for 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon of vanilla.
