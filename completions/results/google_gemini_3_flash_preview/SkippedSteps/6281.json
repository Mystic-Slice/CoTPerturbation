{"id": 6281, "question": "Jenna catches an eel that's 1/3 as long as Bill's. If the combined length of their eels is 64 inches, how long is Jenna's eel?", "solution": "Let j be the length of Jenna's eel and b be the length of Bill's eel. We know that b = 3j and b + j = 64.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3j + j = 64\nCombining like terms, we get 4j = 64\nDividing both sides by 4, we get j = 16\n#### 16", "clean_solution": "Let j be the length of Jenna's eel and b be the length of Bill's eel.

We have the equation from the partial solution: $3j + j = 64$.\n2.  Combine the like terms: $4j = 64$.\n3.  Solve for $j$ by dividing both sides by 4: $j = 64 / 4$.\n4.  $j = 16$.\n\nJenna's eel is 16 inches long. (To verify: If Jenna's is 16, Bill's is $3 \\times 16 = 48$. The sum is $16 + 48 = 64$, which matches the problem statement).\n\n#### 16", "answer_solution_clean": "16", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.
