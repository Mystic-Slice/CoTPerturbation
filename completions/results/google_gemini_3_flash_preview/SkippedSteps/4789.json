{"id": 4789, "question": "Since it is Maurice's turn to host this year\u2019s neighborhood cookout, he goes to the local wholesale club to buy ground beef. The wholesale club sells ground beef in 5-pound packages. Maurice wants to make one 2-pound burger for each person that attends, so he purchases 4 packages of ground beef. How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?", "solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = <<10-1=9>>9 people\n#### 9", "clean_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.", "perturbed_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  Maurice has a total of 20 pounds of ground beef (4 packages * 5 pounds per package).\n2.  Each person (including Maurice) gets one 2-pound burger.\n3.  To find the number of people who can eat, divide the total amount of beef by the weight of one burger: 20 pounds / 2 pounds per person = 10 people.\n\nSince the question asks how many people Maurice can invite so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger, we subtract Maurice from the total:\n10 total people - 1 (Maurice) = 9 people invited.\n\n#### 9", "answer_solution_clean": "9", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Maurice buys 4 packages of ground beef, and each package weighs 5 pounds.\nTotal ground beef = 4 * 5 = 20 pounds.\nEach person (including Maurice) gets one 2-pound burger.\nNumber of people = Total ground beef / Weight per burger\nNumber of people = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10"}
