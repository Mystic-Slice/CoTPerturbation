{"id": 2942, "question": "Gunther just financed a John Deere tractor through the dealership.  If his monthly payment is $150.00 a month, for 5 years, with no interest, how much did he finance the tractor for?", "solution": "There are 12 months in 1 year and his loan is for 5 years so that's 12*5 = <<12*5=60>>60 months\nHis monthly payment is $150.00 and he pays this for 60 months so his loan for the tractor was 150*60 = $<<150*60=9000.00>>9,000.00\n#### 9000", "clean_solution": "There are 12 months in 1 year and his loan is for 5 years so that's 12*5 = 60 months\nHis monthly payment is $150.00 and he pays this for 60 months so his loan for the tractor was 150*60 = $9,000.00", "perturbed_solution": "There are 12 months in 1 year and his loan is for 5 years so that's 12*5 = 60 months\nHis monthly payment is $150.00 and he pays this for 60 months so his loan for the tractor was 150*60 = $9,000.00\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution has already calculated the total number of months and the total loan amount:\n\n1.  Number of months: 12 months/year * 5 years = 60 months.\n2.  Total loan amount: $150.00/month * 60 months = $9,000.00.\n\nSince there is no interest, the total amount of the payments is equal to the amount financed.\n\n#### 9000", "answer_solution_clean": "9000", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  The number of months in the loan period is calculated by multiplying the number of years by the number of months in a year: $12 \\text{ months/year} \\times 5 \\text{ years} = 60 \\text{ months}$.\n2.
