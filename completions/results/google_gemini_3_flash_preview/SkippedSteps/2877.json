{"id": 2877, "question": "Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?", "solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = <<1500/75=20>>20\nThe second route will take 30 hours because 750 / 25 = <<750/25=30>>30\nThe fastest route takes 20 hours because 20 < 30\n#### 20", "clean_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20", "perturbed_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the fastest route, we need to calculate the time it takes for the second route and compare it to the first.\n\n1.  **First Route:** As calculated in the partial solution, the time taken is 1,500 miles / 75 MPH = 20 hours.\n2.  **Second Route:** The time taken is calculated by dividing the total distance by the average speed: 750 miles / 25 MPH = 30 hours.\n3.  **Comparison:** Comparing the two routes, the first route takes 20 hours and the second route takes 30 hours.\n4.  **Fastest Route:** The fastest route is the first one, which takes 20 hours.\n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_clean": "20", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the time for the first route:** As stated, 1,500 miles / 75 MPH = 20 hours.\n2.  **Calculate the time for the second route:** 750 miles / 25 MPH = 30 hours.\n3.  **Compare the two routes:** The first route takes 20 hours and the second route takes 30 hours.\n4.  **Identify the fastest route:** The fastest route is the one that takes the least amount of time, which is 20 hours.\n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_perturbed": "20"}
