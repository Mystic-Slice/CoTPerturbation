{"id": 5897, "question": "Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?", "solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 toy cars\nGrandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 toy cars.\nAll the family together gave Olaf 10 +15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = <<10+15+6+5+10=46>>46.\nAdding the cars Olaf already had, Olaf's collection has 150 + 46 = <<150+46=196>>196 cars.\n#### 196", "clean_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars", "perturbed_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  **Initial collection:** Olaf started with 150 cars.\n2.  **Dad's gift:** 10 toy cars.\n3.  **Mum's gift:** Dad gave 10, which is 5 less than Mum, so Mum gave $10 + 5 = 15$ toy cars.\n4.  **Auntie's gift:** 6 toy cars.\n5.  **Uncle's gift:** Auntie gave 6, which is 1 more than the uncle, so the uncle gave $6 - 1 = 5$ toy cars.\n6.  **Grandpa's gift:** Grandpa gave twice as many as the uncle, so $2 \\times 5 = 10$ toy cars.\n\nNow, we sum all the cars Olaf received:\nTotal gifts = Dad + Mum + Auntie + Uncle + Grandpa\nTotal gifts = $10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 46$ toy cars.\n\nFinally, add the gifts to his initial collection:\nTotal cars = Initial + Total gifts\nTotal cars = $150 + 46 = 196$\n\n#### 196", "answer_solution_clean": "196", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\n1.  **Dad** gave Olaf 10 toy cars.\n2.  **Mum** gave Olaf 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars.\n3.  **Auntie** gave Olaf 6 toy cars.\n4.  **Uncle** gave Olaf 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars.\n5.  **Grandpa** gave Olaf twice as many as the uncle: 2 * 5 = 10 toy cars.\n\nNow, we sum all the gifts:\nGifts = 10 (Dad) + 15 (Mum) + 6 (Auntie) + 5 (Uncle) + 10 (Grandpa)\nGifts = 46 toy cars.\n\nFinally, we add the gifts to Olaf's original collection:\nTotal = 150 (Original) + 46 (Gifts) = 196 toy cars.\n\n#### 196", "answer_solution_perturbed": "196"}
