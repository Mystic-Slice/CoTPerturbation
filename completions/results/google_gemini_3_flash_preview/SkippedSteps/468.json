{"id": 468, "question": "A shopping center sells T-shirts at $8 each, a sweater at $18,  and a jacket at $80. The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. The sales tax is 5%.  Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, four sweaters, and five jackets for his children. How much does Kevin have to pay for all the items, including the sales tax?", "solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $480 = $<<5/100*480=24>>24.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $<<480+24=504>>504. including the sales tax.\n#### 504", "clean_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $400.", "perturbed_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $400.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution has established the base costs:\n- Six T-shirts: $6 \\times \\$8 = \\$48$\n- Four sweaters: $4 \\times \\$18 = \\$72$\n- Five jackets (normal price): $5 \\times \\$80 = \\$400$\n\nNext, we calculate the discount on the jackets:\n- The jackets have a 10% discount: $10\\% \\text{ of } \\$400 = 0.10 \\times \\$400 = \\$40$.\n- The sale price for the five jackets is: $\\$400 - \\$40 = \\$360$.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of all items before tax:\n- Total = $\\$48 \\text{ (T-shirts)} + \\$72 \\text{ (sweaters)} + \\$360 \\text{ (jackets)} = \\$480$.\n\nNext, we calculate the sales tax:\n- The sales tax is 5%: $5\\% \\text{ of } \\$480 = 0.05 \\times \\$480 = \\$24$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total amount Kevin has to pay:\n- Total payment = $\\$480 + \\$24 = \\$504$.\n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_clean": "504", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution has already calculated the base costs:\n- Six T-shirts: $6 \\times \\$8 = \\$48$\n- Four sweaters: $4 \\times \\$18 = \\$72$\n- Five jackets (original price): $5 \\times \\$80 = \\$400$\n\nNow, we apply the discount and tax:\n1. **Calculate the discount on the jackets:** The jackets have a 10% discount.\n   $10\\% \\text{ of } \\$400 = 0.10 \\times \\$400 = \\$40$.\n   Sale price of five jackets = $\\$400 - \\$40 = \\$360$.\n\n2. **Calculate the total subtotal before tax:**\n   Subtotal = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of sweaters + Sale price of jackets\n   Subtotal = $\\$48 + \\$72 + \\$360 = \\$480$.\n\n3. **Calculate the sales tax:** The sales tax is 5%.\n   Tax = $5\\% \\text{ of } \\$480 = 0.05 \\times \\$480 = \\$24$.\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount to pay:**\n   Total = Subtotal + Tax\n   Total = $\\$480 + \\$24 = \\$504$.\n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_perturbed": "504"}
