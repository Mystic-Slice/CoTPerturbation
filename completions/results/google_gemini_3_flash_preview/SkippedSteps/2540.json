{"id": 2540, "question": "Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years. How much money will the art piece have increased by?", "solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $<<12000-4000=8000>>8000\n#### 8000", "clean_solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $8000", "perturbed_solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $8000\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "The partial solution already identifies the core components of the problem:\n1.
