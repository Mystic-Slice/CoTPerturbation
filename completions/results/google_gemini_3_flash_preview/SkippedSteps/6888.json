{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale, we continue from the partial solution:\n\n1.  **Find the sale price per pint:**\n    As calculated, the sale price is $216 / 54 = $4 per pint.\n\n2.  **Find the total revenue without the sale:**\n    The supermarket would have made $216 + $108 = $324.\n\n3.  **Find the price per pint without the sale:**\n    Divide the total non-sale revenue by the number of pints sold:\n    $324 / 54 = $6 per pint.\n\n4.  **Calculate the difference in price:**\n    Subtract the sale price from the non-sale price:\n    $6 - $4 = $2.\n\nThe strawberries cost $2 more per pint when not on sale.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the cost of a pint of strawberries when not on sale, we divide the total amount they would have made by the number of pints sold:\n$324 / 54 = $6.\n\nThe question asks how many more dollars a pint costs when not on sale compared to the sale price.\nThe sale price is $4 per pint.\nThe regular price is $6 per pint.\n\nThe difference is:\n$6 - $4 = $2.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
