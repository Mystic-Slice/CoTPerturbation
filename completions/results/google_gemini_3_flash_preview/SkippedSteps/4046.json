{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nTo find the total earnings for the two months, we add the earnings from the first month and the second month: $200 + $350 = $550.\nSince Sam earns $10 an hour, we divide the total earnings by his hourly rate to find the total number of hours spent tutoring: $550 / $10 = 55.\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of hours Sam spent tutoring, we first need to calculate his total earnings for both months.\n\n1.  **Earnings for the first month:** $200\n2.  **Earnings for the second month:** $200 + $150 = $350\n3.  **Total earnings for two months:** $200 + $350 = $550\n4.  **Hourly rate:** $10 per hour\n5.  **Total hours spent tutoring:** Total earnings / Hourly rate = $550 / $10 = 55 hours\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_perturbed": "55"}
