We know that on one trip, the pickup carries: 10 bags * 50 kg/bag = 500 kg of onions.\n2.  The pickup makes a total of 20 trips.\n3.  To find the total weight, multiply the weight per trip by the number of trips: 500 kg/trip * 20 trips = 10,000 kg.\n\n#### 10000", "answer_solution_clean": "10000", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total weight of onions harvested, we continue from the partial solution:\n\n1.  **Weight per trip:** As calculated, 10 bags \u00d7 50 kg/bag = 500 kg per trip.\n2.  **Total weight for all trips:** Since the pickup makes 20 trips, we multiply the weight per trip by the number of trips:\n    500 kg/trip \u00d7 20 trips = 10,000 kg.\n\n#### 10000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10000"}
