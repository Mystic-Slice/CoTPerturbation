{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the number of unique players Mona grouped with, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total number of player slots filled:**\n    Mona joined 9 groups, and each group had 4 other players.\n    Total slots = 9 groups * 4 players/group = 36 slots.\n\n2.  **Identify the repeat players:**\n    The problem states that some of these players were people she had grouped with *before* that weekend.

The \"before that weekend\" information identifies who those people were (veterans vs. new friends), but they are still unique individuals she played with that weekend.\n\n    Total unique players = 9 groups * 4 players per group = 36.\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_clean": "36", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Mona joined 9 groups, and each group has 4 other players.\nTotal player slots filled = 9 groups * 4 players/group = 36 slots.\n\nTo find the number of unique players, we must subtract the players who were not unique (those she had grouped with before that weekend).\n\n1.
