{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "completed_solution_clean": "Since there are two people (Billy and Jenny), we first find the total cost for both meals:\n25 * 2 = $50\n\nNext, we calculate the total 20% tip for the entire bill:\n50 * 0.20 = $10\n\nBilly wants to cover 80% of this total tip amount:\n10 * 0.80 = $8\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total cost for both Billy and Jenny, we multiply the cost per meal by 2:\n$25 \\times 2 = \\$50$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total 20% tip for the entire bill:\n20% of \\$50 = $0.20 \\times 50 = \\$10$.\n\nBilly wants to cover 80% of this total tip:\n80% of \\$10 = $0.80 \\times 10 = \\$8$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
