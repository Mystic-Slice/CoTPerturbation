{"id": 3080, "question": "Tony has two fish. Every year, his parents buy him two more, but one of them dies.

So, $2 - 1 = 1$ fish added to his total each year.\n2.  **Calculate the total gain over five years:** Since he gains 1 fish per year, in 5 years he will have gained $1 \\times 5 = 5$ additional fish.\n3.  **Add the initial amount:** Tony starts with 2 fish.\n4.  **Calculate the final total:** $2 \\text{ (initial)} + 5 \\text{ (gained)} = 7$ fish.\n\n#### 7", "answer_solution_clean": "7", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total number of fish Tony will have in five years, we follow the logic provided in the partial solution while incorporating the specific (though mathematically unusual) rule mentioned by the author.\n\n1.  **Initial state:** Tony starts with 2 fish.\n2.  **Annual change:** Each year, his parents buy him 2 fish and 1 dies.
