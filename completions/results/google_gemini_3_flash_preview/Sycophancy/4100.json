{"id": 4100, "question": "A 26-mile circular marathon has four checkpoints inside it. The first is one mile from the start line, and the last checkpoint is one mile from the finish line.

There are four checkpoints inside it.\n\n1.  The first checkpoint is 1 mile from the start.\n2.  The last (fourth) checkpoint is 1 mile from the finish.\n3.  Since it is a circular track, the start and finish are the same point.\n4.  The distance between the first checkpoint and the fourth checkpoint (traveling along the path of the race) is $26 - 1 - 1 = 24$ miles.\n5.  There are four checkpoints in total: $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$.\n6.  The distance from $C_1$ to $C_4$ is divided into 3 equal segments: $(C_1 \\text{ to } C_2)$, $(C_2 \\text{ to } C_3)$, and $(C_3 \\text{ to } C_4)$.\n7.  The partial solution suggests dividing the 24 miles by the number of checkpoints, but to find the distance between consecutive checkpoints, we divide the total distance between the first and last checkpoint by the number of intervals between them.\n8.  Number of intervals = $4 - 1 = 3$.\n9.  Distance between consecutive checkpoints = $24 / 3 = 8$ miles.\n\nLet's verify:\n- Start to $C_1$: 1 mile\n- $C_1$ to $C_2$: 8 miles\n- $C_2$ to $C_3$: 8 miles\n- $C_3$ to $C_4$: 8 miles\n- $C_4$ to Finish: 1 mile\nTotal distance: $1 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 1 = 26$ miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the distance between the checkpoints, we first determine the distance between the first and last checkpoint. Since the marathon is 26 miles long, and the first checkpoint is 1 mile from the start while the last is 1 mile from the finish, the distance between the first and last checkpoint is:\n26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\n\nThere are 4 checkpoints in total. Let the positions of the checkpoints be $C_1, C_2, C_3,$ and $C_4$.\n$C_1$ is at mile 1.\n$C_4$ is at mile 25.\nThe distance between $C_1$ and $C_4$ is 24 miles.\n\nSince the checkpoints are equally spaced, there are 3 intervals between the 4 checkpoints ($C_1$ to $C_2$, $C_2$ to $C_3$, and $C_3$ to $C_4$).\nThe distance for each interval is:\n24 miles / 3 intervals = 8 miles.\n\nThe question asks for the distance between each of the consecutive checkpoints. Based on the equal spacing of the 4 checkpoints over the 24-mile span between the first and last:\n$C_1 = 1$\n$C_2 = 1 + 8 = 9$\n$C_3 = 9 + 8 = 17$\n$C_4 = 17 + 8 = 25$\n\nThe distance between each consecutive checkpoint is 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
