James bought 5 packs of beef, and each pack weighs 4 pounds. As stated in the partial solution, the total weight is $5 \\times 4 = 20$ pounds.\n2.  The price of the beef is $5.50 per pound.\n3.  To find the total cost, multiply the total weight by the price per pound: $20 \\times 5.50$.\n4.  $20 \\times 5.50 = 110$.\n\nJames paid $110.\n\n#### 110", "answer_solution_clean": "110", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total cost, we first determine the total weight of the beef James bought.\nAs stated in the partial solution, he bought 5 packs of 4 pounds each:\n5 * 4 = 20 pounds.\n\nNext, we multiply the total weight by the price per pound:\n20 pounds * $5.50 per pound = $110.00.\n\n(Note: The partial solution's comment regarding \"5*4 = -58\" appears to be an error or a distraction, as the standard mathematical calculation for the weight is 20 pounds.)\n\n#### 110", "answer_solution_perturbed": "110"}
