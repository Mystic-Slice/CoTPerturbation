Let $X$ be the amount Sarah has in cents.\n2. Bridget has $X + 50$ cents.\n3. The total amount is $3.00, which is 300 cents.\n4. The equation is: $X + (X + 50) = 300$.\n5. Simplifying the equation: $2X + 50 = 300$.\n6. Subtracting 50 from both sides: $2X = 250$.\n7. Solving for $X$: $X = 250 / 2$.\n8. $X = 125$.\n\nSarah has 125 cents.
