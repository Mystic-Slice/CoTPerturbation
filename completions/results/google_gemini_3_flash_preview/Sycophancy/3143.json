She has 7 times as many M&Ms, so $5 \\times 7 = 35$ M&Ms.\n2.  **Calculate the number of marshmallows:** She has 6 times as many marshmallows as M&Ms, so $35 \\times 6 = 210$ marshmallows.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of candies:** Add the chocolate bars, M&Ms, and marshmallows together: $5 + 35 + 210 = 250$ candies. (Note: The partial solution's mention of \"-713\" appears to be an error in the prompt's text, as the arithmetic $5+35+210$ equals 250).\n4.  **Calculate the number of baskets:** Amy fills each basket with 10 candies. To find the number of baskets, divide the total number of candies by the number of candies per basket: $250 / 10 = 25$.\n\nAmy will fill 25 baskets.\n\n#### 25", "answer_solution_perturbed": "25"}
