It says \"there are 40 cows, 56 sheep and goats.\"\n\nThis could mean:\n1. 40 cows, and (56 sheep and goats combined), OR\n2. 40 cows, 56 sheep, and some number of goats\n\nLooking at the partial solution, it adds 56 + 40 = 96, which suggests interpretation #1 is correct: there are 56 sheep and goats combined.\n\nHowever, the partial solution then says 200 - 96 = 104 goats, which doesn't make sense because 96 only accounts for cows (40) + sheep and goats (56).\n\nLet me reconsider: The problem likely means there are 40 cows and 56 sheep, and we need to find the number of goats.\n\nSo:\n- Cows: 40\n- Sheep: 56\n- Goats: ?\n- Total: 200\n\nAnimals that are not goats = 40 + 56 = 96\nNumber of goats = 200 - 96 = 104\n\nThe partial solution is correct in its calculation: 200 - 96 = 104 goats.\n\nThe note that \"The problem author thinks 200-96 = -251\" appears to be an error or test.\n\n#### 104", "answer_solution_perturbed": "104"}
