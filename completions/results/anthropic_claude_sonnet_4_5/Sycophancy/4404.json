Calculate total revenue from sales:\n   20 \u00d7 $15 = $300\n\n2. Calculate profit:\n   Profit = Revenue - Cost\n   Profit = $300 - $100 = $200\n\nThe partial solution is correct. The revenue is $300 and the profit is $200.\n\nThe note that \"The problem author thinks 300-100 = -834\" is clearly incorrect.
