{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 30 feet long", "answer": 75.0, "perturbed_answer": 30.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find how many trees Holly needs and calculate the total cost.\n\nGiven information:\n- Fence length: 25 yards = 75 feet (from partial solution)\n- Each tree width at maturity: 1.5 feet\n- Cost per tree: $8.00\n\nStep 1: Calculate how many trees are needed\nNumber of trees = Fence length \u00f7 Width per tree\nNumber of trees = 75 feet \u00f7 1.5 feet per tree\nNumber of trees = 50 trees\n\nStep 2: Calculate total cost\nTotal cost = Number of trees \u00d7 Cost per tree\nTotal cost = 50 \u00d7 $8.00\nTotal cost = $400.00\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_clean": "400", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to find how much it will cost Holly to plant privacy trees along her 25-yard fence.\n\nLet me work through this step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Convert fence length to feet**\n- 3 feet = 1 yard\n- Fence is 25 yards long\n- Fence length in feet = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 feet\n\n(Note: The partial solution has an error - it says 3\u00d725 = 30, but it should be 75 feet)\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many trees are needed**\n- Each tree is 1.5 feet wide at maturity\n- Fence length = 75 feet\n- Number of trees needed = 75 \u00f7 1.5 = 50 trees\n\n**Step 3: Calculate total cost**\n- Each tree costs $8.00\n- Number of trees = 50\n- Total cost = 50 \u00d7 $8.00 = $400.00\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_perturbed": "400"}
