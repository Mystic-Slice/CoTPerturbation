{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = 55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = 27 hours on math tutoring for the first two months", "answer": 55.0, "perturbed_answer": 27.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to find the total hours Sam spent tutoring over two months.\n\nGiven information:\n- Sam earns $10 per hour\n- First month: $200\n- Second month: $150 more than the first month\n\nFollowing the partial solution:\n\n**Second month earnings:**\n$200 + $150 = $350\n\n**Total earnings for two months:**\n$200 + $350 = $550\n\n**Total hours spent tutoring:**\nTotal earnings \u00f7 Hourly rate = $550 \u00f7 $10 = 55 hours\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to check the calculation in the partial solution.\n\nGiven information:\n- Sam earns $10 per hour\n- First month: $200\n- Second month: $150 more than the first month\n\nLet me verify the partial solution:\n\nFirst month earnings: $200\nSecond month earnings: $200 + $150 = $350 \u2713\n\nTotal earnings for two months: $200 + $350 = $550 \u2713\n\nTotal hours worked: $550 \u00f7 $10 per hour = 55 hours\n\nThe partial solution has an error in the final calculation.
