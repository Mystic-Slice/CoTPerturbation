{"id": 465, "question": "A man is returning home from work and trying to decide which route to take.  His first route option includes 3 stoplights.  This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.  If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?", "solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = <<10+3*3=19>>19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = <<19-14=5>>5 minutes longer than the second route.\n#### 5", "clean_solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = 19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = 5 minutes longer than the second route.", "perturbed_solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = 19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = 7 minutes longer than the second route.", "answer": 5.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how much longer the first route takes compared to the second route when all 3 stoplights are red.\n\nGiven information:\n- First route: 10 minutes base time + 3 minutes for each red light\n- Second route: 14 minutes (no stoplights)\n- Question asks: how much longer if all 3 lights are red?\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- First route with all red lights: 10 + 3(3) = 10 + 9 = 19 minutes\n- Second route: 14 minutes\n- Difference: 19 - 14 = 5 minutes\n\nThe first route will take 5 minutes longer than the second route.\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_clean": "5", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how much longer the first route takes compared to the second route when all 3 stoplights are red.\n\nGiven information:\n- First route: 10 minutes base time + 3 minutes for each red light\n- Second route: 14 minutes (no stoplights)\n- All 3 stoplights are red\n\nCalculation:\n- First route with all red lights: 10 + (3 \u00d7 3) = 10 + 9 = 19 minutes\n- Second route: 14 minutes\n- Difference: 19 - 14 = 5 minutes\n\nWait, let me reconsider the question. It asks \"how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?\"\n\nThis could mean:\n1. How much longer than the second route? (19 - 14 = 5 minutes)\n2. How much longer than if all lights were green? (19 - 10 = 9 minutes)\n\nLooking at the partial solution provided, it calculates 19 - 14 = 7, but this appears to be an arithmetic error since 19 - 14 = 5.\n\nHowever, the partial solution shows the intent is to compare with the second route.\n\n19 - 14 = 5\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_perturbed": "5"}
