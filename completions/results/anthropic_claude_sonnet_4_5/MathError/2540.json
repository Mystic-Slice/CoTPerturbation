{"id": 2540, "question": "Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years. How much money will the art piece have increased by?", "solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $<<12000-4000=8000>>8000\n#### 8000", "clean_solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $8000", "perturbed_solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $8601", "answer": 8000.0, "perturbed_answer": 8601.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how much the art piece will have increased in value.\n\nGiven information:\n- Rosie bought the art piece 3 years ago for $4000\n- In another 3 years, it will be worth 3 times as much as the purchase price\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Future value (in 3 years) = 3 \u00d7 $4000 = $12,000\n- Increase in value = $12,000 - $4,000 = $8,000\n\nThe art piece will have increased by $8,000 from its original purchase price.\n\n#### 8000", "answer_solution_clean": "8000", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to find how much the art piece will have increased by.\n\nGiven information:\n- Rosie purchased the art piece 3 years ago for $4000\n- In another 3 years, it will be worth three times as much as the original price\n\nStep 1: Calculate the future price\nFuture price = 3 \u00d7 $4000 = $12000\n\nStep 2: Calculate the increase\nIncrease = Future price - Original price\nIncrease = $12000 - $4000 = $8000\n\n(Note: The partial solution had an error showing $8601, but the correct calculation is $8000)\n\n#### 8000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8000"}
