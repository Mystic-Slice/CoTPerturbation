{"id": 6366, "question": "Elsa started the day with 40 marbles.  At breakfast, she lost 3 marbles while playing.  At lunchtime, she gave her best friend Susie 5 marbles.

It also correctly calculated that Susie gave back 10 marbles. However, the final addition is wrong: 44 + 10 = 54, not 68.\n\n#### 54", "answer_solution_perturbed": "54"}
