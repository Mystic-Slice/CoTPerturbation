{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=14 minutes to complete the race.", "answer": 10.0, "perturbed_answer": 14.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find how long it took the third snail to complete the race.\n\nLet me work through this step by step:\n\n**Given information:**\n- First snail: speed = 2 feet per minute\n- Second snail: speed = twice the first snail's speed\n- Third snail: speed = five times the second snail's speed\n- First snail took 20 minutes to complete the race\n\n**Step 1: Find the distance of the sidewalk**\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time\nDistance = 2 feet/minute \u00d7 20 minutes = 40 feet\n\n**Step 2: Find the second snail's speed**\nSecond snail's speed = 2 \u00d7 (first snail's speed)\nSecond snail's speed = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 feet per minute\n\n**Step 3: Verify the partial solution**\nTime for second snail = Distance \u00f7 Speed = 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 minutes \u2713\n(This matches the partial solution)\n\n**Step 4: Find the third snail's speed**\nThird snail's speed = 5 \u00d7 (second snail's speed)\nThird snail's speed = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 feet per minute\n\n**Step 5: Find the time for the third snail**\nTime for third snail = Distance \u00f7 Speed\nTime for third snail = 40 \u00f7 20 = 2 minutes\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to work through this problem step by step, but I notice there's an error in the partial solution.
