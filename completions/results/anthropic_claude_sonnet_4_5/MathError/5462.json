{"id": 5462, "question": "Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?", "solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = <<3*8=24>>24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = <<3*6=18>>18 miles\nNow add the number of miles both people skated to find the total distance between them: 18 miles + 24 miles = <<18+24=42>>42 miles\n#### 42", "clean_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = 18 miles", "perturbed_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = 19 miles", "answer": 18.0, "perturbed_answer": 19.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find the total distance between Ann and Glenda after they skate in opposite directions for 3 hours.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Glenda travels: 3 hours \u00d7 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\n- Ann travels: 3 hours \u00d7 6 miles/hour = 18 miles\n\nSince they start at the same place and skate in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each person traveled:\n\nTotal distance = 24 miles + 18 miles = 42 miles\n\n#### 42", "answer_solution_clean": "42", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution by finding the total distance between Ann and Glenda after 3 hours of skating in opposite directions.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Glenda travels: 3 hours \u00d7 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\n- Ann travels: 3 hours \u00d7 6 miles/hour = 18 miles (Note: The partial solution shows 19 miles, but this should be 18 miles)\n\nSince they start at the same place and skate in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each person traveled:\n\nTotal distance apart = Ann's distance + Glenda's distance\nTotal distance apart = 18 miles + 24 miles = 42 miles\n\n#### 42", "answer_solution_perturbed": "42"}
