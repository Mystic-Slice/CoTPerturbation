{"id": 1034, "question": "When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?", "solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 cups of cream cheese.\nShe uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\nFor each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eggs.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.", "perturbed_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 10 times her ratio.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 10.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to work through this step-by-step using the ratios provided.\n\nGiven information:\n- Ratio of sugar to cream cheese: 1 part sugar to 4 parts cream cheese\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla for every 2 cups cream cheese\n- 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon vanilla\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n\nStep 1: Find how much cream cheese she used.\nIf the ratio is 1 part sugar to 4 parts cream cheese, and she used 2 cups of sugar:\nCream cheese = 2 cups sugar \u00d7 4 = 8 cups cream cheese\n\nStep 2: Find how much vanilla she used.\nShe uses 1 teaspoon vanilla for every 2 cups cream cheese:\nVanilla = 8 cups cream cheese \u00f7 2 = 4 teaspoons vanilla\n\nStep 3: Find how many eggs she used.\nShe uses 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon vanilla:\nEggs = 4 teaspoons vanilla \u00d7 2 = 8 eggs\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to work through this problem step by step, starting with the given partial solution and correcting it if needed.\n\nGiven information:\n- Ratio of sugar to cream cheese: 1 part sugar to 4 parts cream cheese\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla for every 2 cups cream cheese\n- 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon vanilla\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n\nLet me solve this step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Find the amount of cream cheese**\nIf the ratio is 1 part sugar to 4 parts cream cheese, and Betty used 2 cups of sugar:\n- Cream cheese = 2 cups sugar \u00d7 4 = 8 cups cream cheese\n\n**Step 2: Find the amount of vanilla**\n1 teaspoon vanilla for every 2 cups cream cheese:\n- Vanilla = 8 cups cream cheese \u00f7 2 = 4 teaspoons vanilla\n\n**Step 3: Find the number of eggs**\n2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon vanilla:\n- Eggs = 4 teaspoons vanilla \u00d7 2 = 8 eggs\n\nLet me verify this makes sense:\n- 2 cups sugar : 8 cups cream cheese = 1:4 \u2713\n- 8 cups cream cheese \u00f7 2 = 4 teaspoons vanilla \u2713\n- 4 teaspoons vanilla \u00d7 2 = 8 eggs \u2713\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
