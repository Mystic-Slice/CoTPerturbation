Let me solve it correctly:\n\nThe phrase \"56 sheep and goats\" means that sheep and goats together total 56 animals.\n\nSo:\n- Cows: 40\n- Sheep + Goats: 56\n- Total animals that are cows, sheep, or goats: 40 + 56 = 96\n\nSince there are 200 total animals:\n- Other animals (not cows, sheep, or goats): 200 - 96 = 104\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The question asks \"How many goats are there?\" and only mentions cows, sheep, and goats. This suggests these are the only types of animals in the field.\n\nIf cows, sheep, and goats are the only animals:\n- Total: 200\n- Cows: 40\n- Sheep + Goats: 56\n\nBut 40 + 56 = 96, which is less than 200.\n\nLooking at the partial solution again, it calculates 200 - 96 = 104 (not 101 as written).\n\nHowever, this would mean there are 104 other animals, which contradicts the problem setup.\n\nThe most logical interpretation is that the problem means:\n- Total: 200\n- Cows: 40\n- Sheep: 56\n- Goats: ?\n\nTherefore: Goats = 200 - 40 - 56 = 104\n\n#### 104", "answer_solution_perturbed": "104"}
