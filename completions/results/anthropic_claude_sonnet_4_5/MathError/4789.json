{"id": 4789, "question": "Since it is Maurice's turn to host this year\u2019s neighborhood cookout, he goes to the local wholesale club to buy ground beef. The wholesale club sells ground beef in 5-pound packages. Maurice wants to make one 2-pound burger for each person that attends, so he purchases 4 packages of ground beef. How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?", "solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = <<10-1=9>>9 people\n#### 9", "clean_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = 9 people", "perturbed_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = 1 people", "answer": 9.0, "perturbed_answer": 1.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to verify the partial solution and complete it.\n\nGiven information:\n- Each package contains 5 pounds of ground beef\n- Maurice buys 4 packages\n- Each burger requires 2 pounds of ground beef\n- Maurice wants everyone (including himself) to get a burger\n\nStep 1: Calculate total ground beef purchased\n4 packages \u00d7 5 pounds per package = 20 pounds \u2713\n\nStep 2: Calculate number of burgers possible\n20 pounds \u00f7 2 pounds per burger = 10 burgers \u2713\n\nStep 3: Determine how many people can attend\nSince Maurice can make 10 burgers total, and this includes one for himself, the total number of people who can attend (including Maurice) is 10 people.\n\nThe question asks \"How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?\"\n\nThis is asking for the total number of people who can attend and get burgers, which is 10.\n\nNote: If the question were asking how many people Maurice can invite (not including himself), the answer would be 9.
