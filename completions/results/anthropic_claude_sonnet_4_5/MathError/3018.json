{"id": 3018, "question": "Kara has to drink 4 ounces of water every time she takes her medication. Her medication instructions are to take one tablet three times a day. She followed the instructions for one week, but in the second week, she forgot twice on one day. How many ounces of water did she drink with her medication over those two weeks?", "solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = <<84*2=168>>168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = <<168-8=160>>160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = 8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = 160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.", "perturbed_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = 8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = 105 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.", "answer": 160.0, "perturbed_answer": 105.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to verify the partial solution step by step.\n\n**Week 1:**\n- Takes medication 3 times per day\n- Drinks 4 ounces each time\n- Daily water intake: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ounces\n- Weekly water intake: 12 \u00d7 7 = 84 ounces\n\n**Week 2:**\n- Same routine, but forgot twice on one day\n- Normal days (6 days): 12 \u00d7 6 = 72 ounces\n- Day she forgot (1 day): She took only 1 tablet instead of 3 (forgot 2 times)\n- Water on that day: 4 \u00d7 1 = 4 ounces\n- Week 2 total: 72 + 4 = 76 ounces\n\n**Total for two weeks:**\n84 + 76 = 160 ounces\n\nThe partial solution is correct.
