{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog-walking.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 71 hours spent dog-walking.", "answer": 24.0, "perturbed_answer": 71.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find how many poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday.\n\nLet me work through this step by step:\n\n**Given information:**\n- Total time available for the week: 32 hours\n- Time already accounted for: 24 hours (from the partial solution)\n- Time per poodle: 2 hours\n\n**Finding remaining time:**\nRemaining time = Total time - Time already spent\nRemaining time = 32 - 24 = 8 hours\n\n**Finding number of poodles on Tuesday:**\nSince it takes 2 hours to walk each poodle, and Charlotte has 8 hours remaining:\nNumber of poodles = 8 hours \u00f7 2 hours per poodle = 4 poodles\n\n**Verification:**\n- Monday: 4 poodles (8 hours) + 2 Chihuahuas (2 hours) = 10 hours\n- Tuesday: 4 poodles (8 hours) + 2 Chihuahuas (2 hours) = 10 hours\n- Wednesday: 4 Labradors (12 hours) = 12 hours\n- Total: 10 + 10 + 12 = 32 hours \u2713\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to find how many poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday.\n\nLet me first recalculate the hours spent, as there seems to be an error in the partial solution.\n\n**Monday:**\n- 4 poodles \u00d7 2 hours = 8 hours\n- 2 Chihuahuas \u00d7 1 hour = 2 hours\n- Monday total = 8 + 2 = 10 hours\n\n**Tuesday:**\n- 2 Chihuahuas \u00d7 1 hour = 2 hours\n- Let x = number of poodles on Tuesday\n- Poodles: x \u00d7 2 hours = 2x hours\n- Tuesday total = 2 + 2x hours\n\n**Wednesday:**\n- 4 Labradors \u00d7 3 hours = 12 hours\n- Wednesday total = 12 hours\n\n**Total for the week:**\n10 + (2 + 2x) + 12 = 32 hours\n\nSolving for x:\n10 + 2 + 2x + 12 = 32\n24 + 2x = 32\n2x = 32 - 24\n2x = 8\nx = 4\n\nLet me verify:\n- Monday: 8 + 2 = 10 hours\n- Tuesday: 2 + (4 \u00d7 2) = 2 + 8 = 10 hours\n- Wednesday: 12 hours\n- Total: 10 + 10 + 12 = 32 hours \u2713\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
