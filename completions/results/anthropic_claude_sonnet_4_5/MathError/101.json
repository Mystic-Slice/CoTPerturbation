{"id": 101, "question": "Marcy is a makeup artist and has agreed to do some makeup for her friend's wedding. The only makeup she has limited stock of is lip gloss so she counts how many tubes she needs. Each tube of lip gloss will hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. Marcy decides to bring 6 tubs of lip gloss, each of which holds 2 tubes of lip gloss, and this will be the exact amount she needs for everyone's makeup. How many people is Marcy painting with makeup?", "solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = <<6*2=12>>12 tubes of lip gloss.\nSo she must be applying makeup to 12 tubes of lip gloss * 3 people per tube of lip gloss = <<12*3=36>>36 people.\n#### 36", "clean_solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = 12 tubes of lip gloss.", "perturbed_solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = 50 tubes of lip gloss.", "answer": 12.0, "perturbed_answer": 50.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find how many people Marcy is painting with makeup.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss\n- Each tub holds 2 tubes of lip gloss\n- So she has 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 tubes of lip gloss total\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Each tube of lip gloss holds enough for 3 people's makeup\n- She has 12 tubes total\n\nTherefore:\n12 tubes \u00d7 3 people per tube = 36 people\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_clean": "36", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to correct the partial solution and complete the problem.\n\nLet me work through this step by step:\n\n**Given information:**\n- Each tube of lip gloss is enough for 3 people\n- Marcy brings 6 tubs of lip gloss\n- Each tub holds 2 tubes of lip gloss\n- This is the exact amount needed\n\n**Solution:**\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of tubes\n- 6 tubs \u00d7 2 tubes per tub = 12 tubes of lip gloss\n\n(Note: The partial solution incorrectly stated 50 tubes, but 6 \u00d7 2 = 12)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of people\n- 12 tubes \u00d7 3 people per tube = 36 people\n\nTherefore, Marcy is painting makeup for 36 people.\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_perturbed": "36"}
