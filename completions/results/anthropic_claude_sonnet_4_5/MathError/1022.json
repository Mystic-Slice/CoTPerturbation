This is because Rachel is 4 years older, so we need to account for that difference.\n\nLet me solve this properly:\n- Let Leah's age = L\n- Then Rachel's age = L + 4 (since Rachel is 4 years older)\n- Sum of their ages: L + (L + 4) = 34\n\nSolving:\n- 2L + 4 = 34\n- 2L = 30\n- L = 15\n\nSo Leah is 15 years old.\n\nTherefore, Rachel is: 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n\nLet me verify: 15 + 19 = 34 \u2713\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_clean": "19", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to solve for Rachel's age given that Rachel is 4 years older than Leah and their ages sum to 34.\n\nLet me correct and complete the solution:\n\nLet Leah's age = L\nThen Rachel's age = L + 4\n\nSince the sum of their ages is 34:\nL + (L + 4) = 34\n2L + 4 = 34\n2L = 30\nL = 15\n\nTherefore, Leah is 15 years old.\n\nRachel's age = L + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19\n\nLet me verify: 15 + 19 = 34 \u2713\nAnd Rachel is 4 years older than Leah: 19 - 15 = 4 \u2713\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "19"}
