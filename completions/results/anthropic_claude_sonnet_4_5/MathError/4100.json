{"id": 4100, "question": "A 26-mile circular marathon has four checkpoints inside it. The first is one mile from the start line, and the last checkpoint is one mile from the finish line. The checkpoints have equal spacing between them. How many miles apart are each of the consecutive checkpoints between the start-finish line?", "solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6 miles apart.\n#### 6", "clean_solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = 6 miles apart.", "perturbed_solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = 7 miles apart.", "answer": 6.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to verify the solution step by step.\n\nGiven information:\n- 26-mile circular marathon\n- 4 checkpoints inside it\n- First checkpoint is 1 mile from the start line\n- Last checkpoint is 1 mile from the finish line\n- Checkpoints have equal spacing between them\n\nLet me trace through the partial solution:\n\n1.

The partial solution says 24/4 = 6, but that would only work if we're dividing the 24 miles into 4 equal segments. However, between 4 checkpoints, there are only 3 intervals.\n\nThe correct calculation should be:\n- 24 miles divided by 3 intervals (between the 4 checkpoints)\n- 24 \u00f7 3 = 8 miles\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Looking at this problem, I need to verify the solution step by step.\n\nGiven information:\n- 26-mile circular marathon\n- 4 checkpoints inside it\n- First checkpoint is 1 mile from the start line\n- Last checkpoint is 1 mile from the finish line\n- Checkpoints have equal spacing between them\n\nLet me trace through the partial solution:\n\n1.
