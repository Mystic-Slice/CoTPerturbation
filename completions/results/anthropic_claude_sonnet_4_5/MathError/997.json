{"id": 997, "question": "Ittymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?", "solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.\nIf they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=12 fish.", "perturbed_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=89 fish.", "answer": 12.0, "perturbed_answer": 89.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem step by step:\n\nGiven information:\n- Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes\n- Oomyapeck gives 2 eyes to his dog\n- Each fish has 2 eyes\n- The fish are split equally between 3 people (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck)\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Total eyes = 22 (eaten by Oomyapeck) + 2 (given to dog) = 24 eyes\n- Total fish = 24 eyes \u00f7 2 eyes per fish = 12 fish\n\nSince the 12 fish are split equally between the three of them:\n- Fish per person = 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 fish\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to work through this problem step by step.\n\nGiven information:\n- Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes\n- Oomyapeck gives 2 eyes to his dog\n- The fish are split equally between 3 people (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck)\n- Each fish has 2 eyes\n\nLet me correct the partial solution:\n\nStep 1: Find the total number of eyes.\n- Oomyapeck eats: 22 eyes\n- Dog eats: 2 eyes\n- Total eyes: 22 + 2 = 24 eyes\n\nStep 2: Find the total number of fish.\n- Each fish has 2 eyes\n- Total fish: 24 \u00f7 2 = 12 fish\n\nStep 3: Find how many fish each person gets.\n- The fish are split equally between 3 people\n- Fish per person: 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 fish\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
