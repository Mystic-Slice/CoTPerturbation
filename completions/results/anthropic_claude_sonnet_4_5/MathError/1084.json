{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= 8 dollars that Billy should contribute.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= 1 dollars that Billy should contribute.", "answer": 8.0, "perturbed_answer": 1.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to verify the partial solution and complete it.\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the cost per meal\n- Steak: $20\n- Drink: $5\n- Cost per meal: $20 + $5 = $25 \u2713\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate total cost for both people\n- Total cost: $25 \u00d7 2 = $50 \u2713\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the 20% tip on the total\n- 20% tip: $50 \u00d7 0.20 = $10 \u2713\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate 80% of the tip (Billy's portion)\n- Billy's contribution: $10 \u00d7 0.80 = $8 \u2713\n\nThe partial solution is complete and correct.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to check the partial solution and complete it correctly.\n\nLet me verify the steps:\n\n1.
