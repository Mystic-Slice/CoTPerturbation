It states that if Emery took 20 days to read the book, then Serena took 5*20 = 6 days. However, this doesn't seem right.\n\nThe problem states that \"Emery can read five times as fast as Serena.\" This means:\n- Emery reads 5 times faster than Serena\n- If Emery is faster, she takes less time\n- If Emery takes 20 days, and she reads 5 times as fast as Serena, then Serena takes 5 times as long\n\nSo if Emery takes 20 days, Serena takes 5 \u00d7 20 = 100 days.\n\nNow I need to find the average:\nAverage = (Emery's time + Serena's time) / 2\nAverage = (20 + 100) / 2\nAverage = 120 / 2\nAverage = 60 days\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_perturbed": "60"}
