{"id": 3955, "question": "Sandra had 2 different bags of candy.  Each of her bags had 6 pieces of candy left.  Her brother, Roger, also had 2 bags of candy.  One of his bags of candy had 11 pieces left and the other had 3 pieces left.  How much more candy did Roger have?", "solution": "Sandra had 2 bags that each contained 6 pieces of candy so 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 pieces\nRoger had 11 pieces of candy in one bag and 3 pieces in the other so 11+3 = <<11+3=14>>14 pieces\nRoger had 14 pieces and Sandra had 12 pieces so Roger has 14-12 = <<14-12=2>>2 more pieces of candy\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "Sandra had 2 bags that each contained 6 pieces of candy so 2*6 = 12 pieces\nRoger had 11 pieces of candy in one bag and 3 pieces in the other so 11+3 = 14 pieces\nRoger had 14 pieces and Sandra had 12 pieces so Roger has 14-12 = 2 more pieces of candy", "perturbed_solution": "Sandra had 2 bags that each contained 6 pieces of candy so 2*6 = 12 pieces\nRoger had 11 pieces of candy in one bag and 3 pieces in the other so 11+3 = 14 pieces\nRoger had 14 pieces and Sandra had 12 pieces so Roger has 14-12 = 5 more pieces of candy", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 5.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1.
