{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 9 wooden planks.", "answer": 50.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find how many planks Colbert needs to buy from the store.\n\nGiven information:\n- Total planks needed: 200\n- From storage: 1/4 of 200\n- From parents: 1/2 of 200\n- From friends: 20 planks\n- From store: the rest\n\nLet me calculate each source:\n\nFrom storage: 200 / 4 = 50 wooden planks (already given in partial solution)\n\nFrom parents: 200 / 2 = 100 wooden planks\n\nFrom friends: 20 wooden planks\n\nTotal planks from storage, parents, and friends:\n50 + 100 + 20 = 170 wooden planks\n\nPlanks needed from the store:\n200 - 170 = 30 wooden planks\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to solve this step by step, correcting the partial solution.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Total planks needed: 200\n- 1/4 from Colbert's storage\n- 1/2 from Colbert's parents\n- 20 from Colbert's friends\n- Rest from the store\n\n**Step 1:** Planks from Colbert's storage\n200 \u00d7 1/4 = 50 planks (Note: The partial solution incorrectly calculated this as 9)\n\n**Step 2:** Planks from Colbert's parents\n200 \u00d7 1/2 = 100 planks\n\n**Step 3:** Planks from Colbert's friends\n20 planks (given)\n\n**Step 4:** Total planks from all sources except the store\n50 + 100 + 20 = 170 planks\n\n**Step 5:** Planks needed from the store\n200 - 170 = 30 planks\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
