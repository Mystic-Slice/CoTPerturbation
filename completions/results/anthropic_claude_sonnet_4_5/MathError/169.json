{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = 36.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = 81.", "answer": 36.0, "perturbed_answer": 81.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to find the total amount of grapes needed after the 20% increase.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Borris uses 90 kg every 6 months\n- In a year (12 months), he uses: 90 \u00d7 2 = 180 kg\n- The 20% increase amounts to: 180 \u00d7 0.20 = 36 kg\n\nNow I need to add the increase to the original amount:\n- Original yearly amount: 180 kg\n- Increase: 36 kg\n- Total after increase: 180 + 36 = 216 kg\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how many grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing production by 20%.\n\nLet me work through this step by step:\n\n**Current usage:**\n- 90 kg every 6 months\n- In a year (12 months): 90 \u00d7 2 = 180 kg per year\n\n**Increase in production:**\n- 20% increase means he needs 20% more grapes\n- 20% of 180 kg = 180 \u00d7 0.20 = 36 kg (Note: The partial solution shows 81, which appears to be an error)\n\n**Total grapes needed after increase:**\n- Original amount + Increase = 180 + 36 = 216 kg\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate this as:\n- 180 \u00d7 1.20 = 216 kg\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
