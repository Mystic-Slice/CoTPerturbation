The weight bench can support 1000 pounds maximum\n2. John wants to stay 20% under that weight for safety\n3. 20% of 1000 = 1000 \u00d7 0.2 = 200 pounds\n4. So he wants to stay under: 1000 - 200 = 800 pounds (not 291 as stated in the partial solution)\n5. John weighs 250 pounds\n6. The total weight on the bench = John's weight + weight on the bar\n7. So: 250 + weight on bar \u2264 800\n8. Weight on bar = 800 - 250 = 550 pounds\n\n#### 550", "answer_solution_perturbed": "550"}
