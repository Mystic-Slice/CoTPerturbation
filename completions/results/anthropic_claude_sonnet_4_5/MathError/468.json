{"id": 468, "question": "A shopping center sells T-shirts at $8 each, a sweater at $18,  and a jacket at $80. The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. The sales tax is 5%.  Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, four sweaters, and five jackets for his children. How much does Kevin have to pay for all the items, including the sales tax?", "solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $480 = $<<5/100*480=24>>24.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $<<480+24=504>>504. including the sales tax.\n#### 504", "clean_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.", "perturbed_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $41.", "answer": 72.0, "perturbed_answer": 41.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution to find the total cost including the sales tax.\n\nGiven information:\n- T-shirts: $8 each\n- Sweaters: $18 each\n- Jackets: $80 each with 10% discount\n- Sales tax: 5%\n- Kevin buys: 6 T-shirts, 4 sweaters, 5 jackets\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Six T-shirts cost: 6 \u00d7 $8 = $48\n- Four sweaters cost: 4 \u00d7 $18 = $72\n\nContinuing:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of jackets**\n- Original price per jacket: $80\n- Discount: 10% of $80 = 0.10 \u00d7 $80 = $8\n- Discounted price per jacket: $80 - $8 = $72\n- Five jackets cost: 5 \u00d7 $72 = $360\n\n**Step 2: Calculate subtotal (before tax)**\nSubtotal = T-shirts + Sweaters + Jackets\nSubtotal = $48 + $72 + $360 = $480\n\n**Step 3: Calculate sales tax**\nSales tax = 5% of $480 = 0.05 \u00d7 $480 = $24\n\n**Step 4: Calculate total cost**\nTotal cost = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal cost = $480 + $24 = $504\n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_clean": "504", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete the solution for Kevin's purchase.\n\nGiven information:\n- T-shirts: $8 each\n- Sweaters: $18 each\n- Jackets: $80 each with 10% discount\n- Sales tax: 5%\n- Kevin buys: 6 T-shirts, 4 sweaters, 5 jackets\n\nPartial solution provided:\n- Six T-shirts cost: 6 \u00d7 $8 = $48\n- Four sweaters cost: 4 \u00d7 $18 = $72 (Note: The partial solution shows $41, which is incorrect.
