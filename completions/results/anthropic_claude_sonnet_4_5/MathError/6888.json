{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $2 more when not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $7 more when not on sale.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to verify the partial solution and complete it.\n\nGiven information:\n- 54 pints were sold\n- They made $216 from the sale\n- This was $108 less than they would have made without the sale\n\nStep 1: Find the sale price per pint\nSale price per pint = $216 \u00f7 54 = $4\n\nStep 2: Find the revenue without the sale\nRevenue without sale = $216 + $108 = $324\n\nStep 3: Find the regular price per pint\nRegular price per pint = $324 \u00f7 54 = $6\n\nStep 4: Find the difference\nDifference = $6 - $4 = $2\n\nThe partial solution is correct.
