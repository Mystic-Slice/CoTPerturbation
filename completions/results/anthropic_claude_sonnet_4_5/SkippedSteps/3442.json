{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution to find Gary's total earnings.\n\n**Given information:**\n- 6 pounds of flour total\n- 4 pounds for cakes (0.5 pounds each)\n- 2 pounds for cupcakes (1/5 pounds each)\n- Cakes sell for $2.5 each\n- Cupcakes sell for $1 each\n\n**Solution:**\n\nFrom the partial solution: Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\n\nNow I need to find how many cupcakes he can bake:\n- Cupcakes from 2 pounds of flour: 2 \u00f7 (1/5) = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 cupcakes\n\nCalculate earnings from cakes:\n- 8 cakes \u00d7 $2.5 = $20\n\nCalculate earnings from cupcakes:\n- 10 cupcakes \u00d7 $1 = $10\n\nTotal earnings:\n- $20 + $10 = $30\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete the solution to find out how much Gary will earn.\n\nGiven information:\n- Gary has 6 pounds of flour total\n- 4 pounds for cakes (0.5 pounds each)\n- 2 pounds for cupcakes (1/5 pounds each)\n- Cakes sell for $2.5 each\n- Cupcakes sell for $1 each\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour\n\nNow I need to calculate the cupcakes:\n- Cupcakes from 2 pounds of flour: 2 \u00f7 (1/5) = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 cupcakes\n\nCalculate earnings:\n- Earnings from cakes: 8 cakes \u00d7 $2.5 = $20\n- Earnings from cupcakes: 10 cupcakes \u00d7 $1 = $10\n- Total earnings: $20 + $10 = $30\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
