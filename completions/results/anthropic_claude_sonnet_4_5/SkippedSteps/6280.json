{"id": 6280, "question": "Janet buys a multi-flavor pack of cheese sticks. 15 of the sticks are cheddar, 30 are mozzarella, and 45 are pepperjack. If Janet picks a cheese stick at random, what is the percentage chance it will be pepperjack?", "solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = <<15+30+45=90>>90 cheese sticks\nThen divide the number of pepperjack sticks by the total number of cheese sticks and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 45 pepperjack sticks / 90 cheese sticks * 100% = 50%\n#### 50", "clean_solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 90 cheese sticks", "perturbed_solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 90 cheese sticks\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find the percentage chance that Janet picks a pepperjack cheese stick.\n\nFrom the partial solution, I have:\n- Total cheese sticks = 90\n- Pepperjack cheese sticks = 45\n\nTo find the percentage:\nPercentage = (Number of pepperjack sticks / Total number of sticks) \u00d7 100\n\nPercentage = (45 / 90) \u00d7 100\n\nPercentage = 0.5 \u00d7 100\n\nPercentage = 50\n\n#### 50", "answer_solution_clean": "50", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Looking at this problem, I need to find the percentage chance of picking a pepperjack cheese stick.\n\nFrom the partial solution, I have:\n- Total cheese sticks = 90\n- Pepperjack cheese sticks = 45\n\nTo find the percentage:\nPercentage = (Number of pepperjack sticks / Total sticks) \u00d7 100\nPercentage = (45 / 90) \u00d7 100\nPercentage = 0.5 \u00d7 100\nPercentage = 50\n\n#### 50", "answer_solution_perturbed": "50"}
