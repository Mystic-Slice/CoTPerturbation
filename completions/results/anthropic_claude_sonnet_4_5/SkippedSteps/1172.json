{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution to find how many planks Colbert needs to buy from the store.\n\nGiven information:\n- Total planks needed: 200\n- From storage: 200/4 = 50 planks (already calculated)\n- From parents: half of 200 = 200/2 = 100 planks\n- From friends: 20 planks\n- From store: the rest\n\nLet me calculate the total planks from all sources except the store:\n- Storage: 50 planks\n- Parents: 100 planks\n- Friends: 20 planks\n- Total from these sources: 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 planks\n\nPlanks needed from the store:\n200 - 170 = 30 planks\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how many planks Colbert needs to buy from the store.\n\nGiven information:\n- Total planks needed: 200\n- From storage: 1/4 of 200 = 50 planks\n- From parents: 1/2 of 200 = 100 planks\n- From friends: 20 planks\n- From store: the rest\n\nLet me calculate the planks from all sources except the store:\n- Storage: 50 planks\n- Parents: 100 planks\n- Friends: 20 planks\n- Total from these sources: 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 planks\n\nPlanks needed from store = Total needed - Planks already accounted for\nPlanks needed from store = 200 - 170 = 30 planks\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
