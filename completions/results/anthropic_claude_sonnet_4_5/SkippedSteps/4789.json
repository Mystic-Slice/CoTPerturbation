{"id": 4789, "question": "Since it is Maurice's turn to host this year\u2019s neighborhood cookout, he goes to the local wholesale club to buy ground beef. The wholesale club sells ground beef in 5-pound packages. Maurice wants to make one 2-pound burger for each person that attends, so he purchases 4 packages of ground beef. How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?", "solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = <<10-1=9>>9 people\n#### 9", "clean_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.", "perturbed_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how many people Maurice can invite (plus himself) based on the ground beef he purchased.\n\nGiven information:\n- Maurice buys 4 packages of ground beef\n- Each package is 5 pounds\n- Each burger requires 2 pounds\n- Maurice wants everyone (including himself) to get a burger\n\nFrom the partial solution:\nMaurice buys 4 \u00d7 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef\n\nNow I need to calculate how many 2-pound burgers he can make:\nNumber of burgers = 20 pounds \u00f7 2 pounds per burger = 10 burgers\n\nSince Maurice gets one burger himself, and there are 10 total burgers:\nNumber of people Maurice can invite = 10 - 1 = 9 people\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The question asks \"How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?\"\n\nThis is asking for the total number of people who can attend (including Maurice), not just the number of guests.\n\nTotal people who can attend = 10 burgers = 10 people (including Maurice)\n\nBut reading more carefully, it says \"How many people can Maurice invite\" - this typically means guests only, not including Maurice himself.\n\nSo: Maurice can invite 9 people (and with himself, that's 10 people total getting burgers).\n\nHowever, the phrasing \"so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger\" suggests we're counting total attendees.\n\nLet me go with the most straightforward interpretation: 10 burgers means 10 people total can be fed.\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_clean": "10", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how many people Maurice can invite (plus himself) given the amount of ground beef he purchased.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Maurice buys 4 packages \u00d7 5 pounds per package = 20 pounds of ground beef\n\nSince each burger requires 2 pounds of ground beef:\n- Number of burgers Maurice can make = 20 pounds \u00f7 2 pounds per burger = 10 burgers\n\nSince Maurice wants everyone including himself to get a burger:\n- Total number of people who can attend (including Maurice) = 10 people\n\nTherefore, the number of people Maurice can invite (not including himself) = 10 - 1 = 9 people\n\nHowever, if the question is asking for the total number of people who can get a burger (including Maurice), the answer is 10.\n\nReading the question again: \"How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?\"\n\nThis is asking for the number of people Maurice can invite.
