{"id": 5958, "question": "Tony lifts weights as a form of exercise.  He can lift 90 pounds with one arm in the exercise known as \"the curl.\"  In an exercise known as \"the military press,\" he can lift over his head twice the weight that he can curl.  His favorite exercise is known as \"the squat\" and he can squat 5 times the weight that he can lift in the military press.  How much weight, in pounds, can Tony lift in the squat exercise?", "solution": "If Tony can curl 90 pounds, he can military press 2*90=<<90*2=180>>180 pounds.\nTherefore, Tony can squat 5*180=<<5*180=900>>900 pounds.\n#### 900", "clean_solution": "If Tony can curl 90 pounds, he can military press 2*90=180 pounds.\nTherefore, Tony can squat 5*180=900 pounds.", "perturbed_solution": "If Tony can curl 90 pounds, he can military press 2*90=180 pounds.\nTherefore, Tony can squat 5*180=900 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to verify the partial solution and complete it.\n\nGiven information:\n- Tony can curl 90 pounds with one arm\n- Military press = 2 \u00d7 curl weight\n- Squat = 5 \u00d7 military press weight\n\nStep 1: Calculate military press weight\nMilitary press = 2 \u00d7 90 = 180 pounds \u2713\n\nStep 2: Calculate squat weight\nSquat = 5 \u00d7 180 = 900 pounds \u2713\n\nThe partial solution is correct and complete.\n\n#### 900", "answer_solution_clean": "900", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to verify the solution step by step.\n\nGiven information:\n- Tony can curl 90 pounds with one arm\n- Military press: he can lift twice the weight he can curl\n- Squat: he can lift 5 times the weight he can military press\n\nStep 1: Calculate military press weight\nMilitary press = 2 \u00d7 curl weight\nMilitary press = 2 \u00d7 90 = 180 pounds\n\nStep 2: Calculate squat weight\nSquat = 5 \u00d7 military press weight\nSquat = 5 \u00d7 180 = 900 pounds\n\nThe partial solution is correct.\n\n#### 900", "answer_solution_perturbed": "900"}
