{"id": 5897, "question": "Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?", "solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 toy cars\nGrandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 toy cars.\nAll the family together gave Olaf 10 +15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = <<10+15+6+5+10=46>>46.\nAdding the cars Olaf already had, Olaf's collection has 150 + 46 = <<150+46=196>>196 cars.\n#### 196", "clean_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars", "perturbed_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at the partial solution, I need to continue from where it left off.\n\nGiven information:\n- Olaf started with 150 cars\n- Dad gave 10 cars\n- Mom gave 15 cars (5 more than Dad)\n- Auntie gave 6 cars\n- Uncle gave 5 cars (1 less than Auntie)\n- Grandpa gave twice as many as Uncle\n\nNow I need to find how many Grandpa gave:\nGrandpa gave twice as many as Uncle, so 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 toy cars\n\nTotal cars received as gifts:\n10 (Dad) + 15 (Mom) + 6 (Auntie) + 5 (Uncle) + 10 (Grandpa) = 46 toy cars\n\nTotal cars Olaf has now:\n150 (original) + 46 (gifts) = 196 toy cars\n\n#### 196", "answer_solution_clean": "196", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution step by step.\n\nGiven information:\n- Olaf started with 150 cars\n- Dad gave 10 cars\n- Mom gave 5 MORE than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 cars\n- Auntie gave 6 cars\n- Uncle gave 1 LESS than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 cars\n- Grandpa gave TWICE as many as Uncle, so 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 cars\n\nNow I need to add all the cars together:\n- Starting collection: 150 cars\n- Dad: 10 cars\n- Mom: 15 cars\n- Auntie: 6 cars\n- Uncle: 5 cars\n- Grandpa: 10 cars\n\nTotal = 150 + 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 196 cars\n\n#### 196", "answer_solution_perturbed": "196"}
