{"id": 3018, "question": "Kara has to drink 4 ounces of water every time she takes her medication. Her medication instructions are to take one tablet three times a day. She followed the instructions for one week, but in the second week, she forgot twice on one day. How many ounces of water did she drink with her medication over those two weeks?", "solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = <<84*2=168>>168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = <<168-8=160>>160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.", "perturbed_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to calculate the water consumption for two weeks separately.\n\n**Week 1:**\n- Kara takes medication 3 times per day\n- She drinks 4 ounces each time\n- Daily water consumption: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ounces\n- Weekly water consumption: 12 \u00d7 7 = 84 ounces\n\n**Week 2:**\n- She followed the normal routine for 6 days: 12 \u00d7 6 = 72 ounces\n- On one day, she \"forgot twice\" - this means she only took her medication 1 time instead of 3 times\n- Water on that day: 4 \u00d7 1 = 4 ounces\n- Week 2 total: 72 + 4 = 76 ounces\n\n**Total for both weeks:**\n84 + 76 = 160 ounces\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to calculate the total water Kara drank over two weeks.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water per day (when she takes all doses)\n- In a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces\n\nNow I need to complete the calculation:\n\n**Week 1:** She followed instructions perfectly\n- Water consumed = 84 ounces\n\n**Week 2:** She forgot twice on one day\n- She normally takes 3 tablets per day\n- On the day she forgot twice, she only took 1 tablet\n- So she drank 4 * 1 = 4 ounces that day (instead of 12 ounces)\n- For the other 6 days of week 2, she drank 12 ounces per day\n- Week 2 total = 4 + (12 * 6) = 4 + 72 = 76 ounces\n\n**Total over two weeks:**\n84 + 76 = 160 ounces\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_perturbed": "160"}
