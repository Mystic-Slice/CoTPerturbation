{"id": 6281, "question": "Jenna catches an eel that's 1/3 as long as Bill's. If the combined length of their eels is 64 inches, how long is Jenna's eel?", "solution": "Let j be the length of Jenna's eel and b be the length of Bill's eel. We know that b = 3j and b + j = 64.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3j + j = 64\nCombining like terms, we get 4j = 64\nDividing both sides by 4, we get j = 16\n#### 16", "clean_solution": "Let j be the length of Jenna's eel and b be the length of Bill's eel. We know that b = 3j and b + j = 64.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3j + j = 64", "perturbed_solution": "Let j be the length of Jenna's eel and b be the length of Bill's eel.
