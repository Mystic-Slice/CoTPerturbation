{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find how many trees Holly needs and calculate the total cost.\n\nGiven information:\n- Fence length: 25 yards = 75 feet (from partial solution)\n- Each tree width at maturity: 1.5 feet\n- Cost per tree: $8.00\n\nStep 1: Calculate how many trees are needed\nNumber of trees = Fence length \u00f7 Width per tree\nNumber of trees = 75 \u00f7 1.5\nNumber of trees = 50 trees\n\nStep 2: Calculate total cost\nTotal cost = Number of trees \u00d7 Cost per tree\nTotal cost = 50 \u00d7 $8.00\nTotal cost = $400.00\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_clean": "400", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to find how many trees Holly needs and calculate the total cost.\n\nGiven information:\n- Fence length: 25 yards = 75 feet (as calculated in the partial solution)\n- Each tree width at maturity: 1.5 feet\n- Cost per tree: $8.00\n\nStep 1: Calculate how many trees are needed\nNumber of trees = Fence length \u00f7 Width per tree\nNumber of trees = 75 feet \u00f7 1.5 feet per tree\nNumber of trees = 50 trees\n\nStep 2: Calculate total cost\nTotal cost = Number of trees \u00d7 Cost per tree\nTotal cost = 50 \u00d7 $8.00\nTotal cost = $400.00\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_perturbed": "400"}
