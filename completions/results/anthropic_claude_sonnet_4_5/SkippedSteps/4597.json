{"id": 4597, "question": "Mason is mixing up some salad dressing. He takes a bowl that holds 150 ml and fills it 2/3rds with oil and 1/3rd with vinegar. The oil weighs 5 g/ml and the vinegar weighs 4 g/ml. How many grams does the salad dressing weigh?", "solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = <<150*2/3=100>>100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = <<150*1/3=50>>50 ml\nNow find the weight of the oil by multiplying the volume by the weight/volume ratio: 100 ml * 5 g/ml = <<100*5=500>>500 g\nDo the same procedure with the weight and weight/volume ratio of the vinegar to find its weight: 50 ml * 4 g/ml = <<50*4=200>>200 g\nNow add the weight of the oil and the vinegar to find the weight of the salad dressing: 500 g + 200 g = <<500+200=700>>700 g\n#### 700", "clean_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 50 ml", "perturbed_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 50 ml\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find the total weight of the salad dressing by calculating the weight of oil and vinegar separately, then adding them together.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Volume of oil: 100 ml\n- Volume of vinegar: 50 ml\n\nNow I'll calculate the weights:\n\nWeight of oil = Volume of oil \u00d7 Density of oil\nWeight of oil = 100 ml \u00d7 5 g/ml = 500 g\n\nWeight of vinegar = Volume of vinegar \u00d7 Density of vinegar\nWeight of vinegar = 50 ml \u00d7 4 g/ml = 200 g\n\nTotal weight of salad dressing = Weight of oil + Weight of vinegar\nTotal weight = 500 g + 200 g = 700 g\n\n#### 700", "answer_solution_clean": "700", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution by finding the total weight of the salad dressing.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Oil volume: 100 ml\n- Vinegar volume: 50 ml\n\nNow I need to find the weight of each component:\n\nWeight of oil = volume \u00d7 density = 100 ml \u00d7 5 g/ml = 500 g\n\nWeight of vinegar = volume \u00d7 density = 50 ml \u00d7 4 g/ml = 200 g\n\nTotal weight of salad dressing = weight of oil + weight of vinegar = 500 g + 200 g = 700 g\n\n#### 700", "answer_solution_perturbed": "700"}
