{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find how much Billy will pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for both meals.\n\nFrom the partial solution: Each meal costs $25\n\nSince there are 2 people (Billy and Jenny), the total bill is:\n2 \u00d7 $25 = $50\n\nThe total tip at 20% would be:\n$50 \u00d7 0.20 = $10\n\nBilly wants to cover 80% of this tip:\n$10 \u00d7 0.80 = $8\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to find how much Billy will pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for both meals.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Cost per meal = $20 (steak) + $5 (drink) = $25\n\nNow I'll continue:\n- Total cost for both meals = $25 \u00d7 2 = $50\n\n- 20% tip on the total = $50 \u00d7 0.20 = $10\n\n- Billy wants to cover 80% of this tip = $10 \u00d7 0.80 = $8\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
