{"id": 5921, "question": "Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?", "solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.\nAt 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.\nAdding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.\nSince each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars\n#### 10", "clean_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 225 cents.", "perturbed_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 225 cents.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to complete the solution by calculating the cost of the international call and finding the total cost in dollars.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Call to dad (local): 45 minutes at 5 cents per minute\n- Call to brother (international): 31 minutes at 25 cents per minute\n\n**Solution:**\n\nCost of calling dad (local):\n5 cents \u00d7 45 minutes = 225 cents\n\nCost of calling brother (international):\n25 cents \u00d7 31 minutes = 775 cents\n\nTotal cost in cents:\n225 + 775 = 1000 cents\n\nConvert to dollars:\n1000 cents \u00f7 100 = 10 dollars\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_clean": "10", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete the calculation for Freddy's total phone bill.\n\nGiven information:\n- Call to dad (local): 45 minutes at 5 cents per minute\n- Call to brother (international): 31 minutes at 25 cents per minute\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Cost of calling dad: 5 \u00d7 45 = 225 cents\n\nNow I need to calculate the cost of calling his brother:\n- Cost of calling brother: 25 \u00d7 31 = 775 cents\n\nTotal cost in cents:\n- Total = 225 + 775 = 1000 cents\n\nConvert to dollars:\n- 1000 cents = 1000 \u00f7 100 = 10 dollars\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10"}
