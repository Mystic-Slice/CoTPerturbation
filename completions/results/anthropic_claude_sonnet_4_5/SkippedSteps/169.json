{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find how many grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing his production by 20%.\n\nGiven information:\n- Borris uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months\n- He wants to increase production by 20%\n\nStep 1: Calculate current yearly usage\nThe partial solution shows: 90 \u00d7 2 = 180 kilograms per year\n\nStep 2: Calculate the increase\n20% of 180 = 0.20 \u00d7 180 = 36 kilograms\n\nStep 3: Calculate total grapes needed after the increase\n180 + 36 = 216 kilograms\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate this as:\n180 \u00d7 1.20 = 216 kilograms\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how many grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing production by 20%.\n\nGiven information:\n- Current usage: 90 kg every 6 months\n- Current yearly usage: 90 \u00d7 2 = 180 kg per year\n- Production increase: 20%\n\nTo find the new amount needed after a 20% increase:\n180 kg \u00d7 1.20 = 216 kg\n\nAlternatively: 180 kg + (180 kg \u00d7 0.20) = 180 kg + 36 kg = 216 kg\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
