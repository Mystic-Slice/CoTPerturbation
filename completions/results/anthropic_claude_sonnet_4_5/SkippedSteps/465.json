{"id": 465, "question": "A man is returning home from work and trying to decide which route to take.  His first route option includes 3 stoplights.  This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.  If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?", "solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = <<10+3*3=19>>19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = <<19-14=5>>5 minutes longer than the second route.\n#### 5", "clean_solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = 19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = 5 minutes longer than the second route.", "perturbed_solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = 19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = 5 minutes longer than the second route.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how much longer the first route takes compared to the second route when all 3 stoplights are red.\n\nGiven information:\n- First route with all green lights: 10 minutes\n- Each red light adds: 3 minutes\n- Second route: 14 minutes\n- Number of stoplights: 3\n\nFollowing the partial solution:\n\nStep 1: Calculate time for first route with all red lights\nTime = 10 + (3 \u00d7 3) = 10 + 9 = 19 minutes\n\nStep 2: Calculate the difference between the two routes\nDifference = 19 - 14 = 5 minutes\n\nThe first route will take 5 minutes longer than the second route when all 3 stoplights are red.\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_clean": "5", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to find how much longer the first route will be compared to the second route if all 3 stoplights are red.\n\nGiven information:\n- First route: 10 minutes if all lights are green\n- Each red light adds 3 minutes\n- Second route: 14 minutes (no stoplights)\n- Question asks: How much longer if all 3 lights are red?\n\nSolution:\nIf all 3 stoplights are red:\n- Time for first route = 10 + (3 \u00d7 3) = 10 + 9 = 19 minutes\n\nDifference between first route (with all red lights) and second route:\n- Difference = 19 - 14 = 5 minutes\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_perturbed": "5"}
