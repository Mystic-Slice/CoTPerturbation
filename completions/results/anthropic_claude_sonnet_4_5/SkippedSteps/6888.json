{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale.\n\nGiven information:\n- 54 pints were sold on sale\n- They made $216 from the sale\n- This was $108 less than they would have made without the sale\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- On sale, a pint costs: $216 \u00f7 54 = $4\n- Without the sale, they would have made: $216 + $108 = $324\n\nNow I need to find the regular price (not on sale):\n- Regular price per pint = $324 \u00f7 54 = $6\n\nThe difference in price:\n- Difference = $6 - $4 = $2\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to find how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale.\n\nGiven information:\n- 54 pints were sold on sale\n- They made $216 from the sale\n- This was $108 less than they would have made without the sale\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- On sale price per pint: $216 \u00f7 54 = $4\n- Revenue without sale: $216 + $108 = $324\n\nNow I need to find the regular price per pint:\n- Regular price per pint: $324 \u00f7 54 = $6\n\nThe difference between regular price and sale price:\n- $6 - $4 = $2\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
