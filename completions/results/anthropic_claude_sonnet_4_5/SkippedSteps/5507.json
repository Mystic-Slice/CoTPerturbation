{"id": 5507, "question": "John's weight bench can support 1000 pounds.  He wants to make sure to stay 20% under that weight for safety.  If he weighs 250 pounds how much weight can he put on the bar?", "solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=<<1000*.2=200>>200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=<<1000-200=800>>800 pounds\nThat means he can put 800-250=<<800-250=550>>550 pounds on the bar\n#### 550", "clean_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max", "perturbed_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how much weight John can put on the bar.\n\nGiven information:\n- Weight bench max capacity: 1000 pounds\n- John wants to stay 20% under max for safety\n- John's weight: 250 pounds\n\nStep 1: Calculate 20% of 1000 pounds\n1000 \u00d7 0.2 = 200 pounds\n\nStep 2: Calculate the safe weight limit\n1000 - 200 = 800 pounds\n\nStep 3: Calculate how much weight can go on the bar\nThe safe weight limit includes both John's body weight and the weights on the bar.\nWeight on bar = Safe limit - John's weight\nWeight on bar = 800 - 250 = 550 pounds\n\n#### 550", "answer_solution_clean": "550", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Looking at this problem, I need to find how much weight John can put on the bar.\n\nGiven information:\n- Weight bench capacity: 1000 pounds\n- John wants to stay 20% under capacity for safety\n- John's weight: 250 pounds\n\nStep 1: Calculate 20% of the maximum capacity\n20% of 1000 = 1000 \u00d7 0.2 = 200 pounds\n\nStep 2: Calculate the safe maximum weight\nSafe maximum = 1000 - 200 = 800 pounds\n\nStep 3: Calculate how much weight can go on the bar\nThe safe maximum includes both John's body weight and the weight on the bar.\nWeight on bar = Safe maximum - John's weight\nWeight on bar = 800 - 250 = 550 pounds\n\n#### 550", "answer_solution_perturbed": "550"}
