The problem states \"56 sheep and goats\" which means 56 is the combined total of sheep AND goats together.\n\nSo:\n- Cows: 40\n- Sheep + Goats: 56\n- Total animals: 200\n\nAnimals other than sheep and goats = Cows + other animals\nTotal = Cows + Sheep + Goats + other animals\n\nActually, the partial solution shows: 56 + 40 = 96\n\nThis means they're adding cows (40) and \"sheep and goats\" (56) to get 96 animals that are accounted for.\n\nThen: 200 - 96 = 104\n\nThis would mean there are 104 other animals that are neither cows, nor part of the \"56 sheep and goats.\"\n\nBut this interpretation seems odd. Let me reconsider if \"56 sheep and goats\" means there are 56 sheep, and separately there are goats.\n\nIf that's the case:\n- Cows: 40\n- Sheep: 56  \n- Goats: ?\n- Total: 200\n\nThen: Goats = 200 - 40 - 56 = 104\n\nThis matches the partial solution's calculation.\n\n#### 104", "answer_solution_perturbed": "104"}
