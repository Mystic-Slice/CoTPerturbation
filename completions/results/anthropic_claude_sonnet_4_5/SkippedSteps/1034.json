{"id": 1034, "question": "When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?", "solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 cups of cream cheese.\nShe uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\nFor each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eggs.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese.", "perturbed_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to work through this step-by-step using the given ratios.\n\nGiven information:\n- Ratio of sugar to cream cheese: 1 part sugar to 4 parts cream cheese\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese\n- 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon of vanilla\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n- Since the ratio is 1:4 (sugar:cream cheese), she used 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese\n\nNow I need to find how many eggs she used:\n\nStep 1: Find how much vanilla she used\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese\n- She used 8 cups of cream cheese\n- Vanilla used = 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla\n\nStep 2: Find how many eggs she used\n- 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon of vanilla\n- She used 4 teaspoons of vanilla\n- Eggs used = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 eggs\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution step by step.\n\nGiven information:\n- Ratio of sugar to cream cheese: 1 part sugar to 4 parts cream cheese\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese\n- 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon of vanilla\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n- Since the ratio is 1:4 (sugar:cream cheese), she used 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese\n\nNow I need to find how many eggs she used:\n\nStep 1: Find how many teaspoons of vanilla she used\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese\n- She used 8 cups of cream cheese\n- Vanilla used = 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 teaspoons\n\nStep 2: Find how many eggs she used\n- 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon of vanilla\n- She used 4 teaspoons of vanilla\n- Eggs used = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 eggs\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
