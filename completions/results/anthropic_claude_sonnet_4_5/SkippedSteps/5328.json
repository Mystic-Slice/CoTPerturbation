{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find the number of unique players Mona grouped with.\n\nGiven information:\n- Mona joins groups with 4 other players (so 5 total including her, but 4 others)\n- She joined 9 groups\n- One group included 2 players she had grouped with before that weekend\n- Another group included 1 player she had grouped with before\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Total player slots = 9 groups \u00d7 4 players per group = 36 player slots\n\nNow I need to account for the repeated players:\n- In one group, 2 players were repeats (people she had already grouped with earlier that weekend)\n- In another group, 1 player was a repeat\n\nSo the number of repeated player slots = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTherefore, the number of unique players = Total player slots - Repeated player slots\n= 36 - 3 = 33\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_clean": "33", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to find the number of unique players Mona grouped with.\n\nLet me work through this step-by-step:\n\n1) Mona joined 9 groups, and each group has 4 other players (besides Mona)\n   Total player slots = 9 \u00d7 4 = 36\n\n2) However, some players were repeated:\n   - One group included 2 players she had grouped with before that weekend\n   - Another group included 1 player she had grouped with before that weekend\n\n3) To find unique players, I need to subtract the repeats from the total:\n   - The 2 players who appeared again means 2 duplicate slots\n   - The 1 player who appeared again means 1 duplicate slot\n   - Total duplicates = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n4) Unique players = Total player slots - Duplicates\n   Unique players = 36 - 3 = 33\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
