{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "Looking at this problem, I need to find the total hours Sam spent tutoring over two months.\n\nGiven information:\n- Sam earns $10 per hour\n- First month: $200\n- Second month: $150 more than the first month\n\nFrom the partial solution:\nSecond month earnings = $200 + $150 = $350\n\nNow I can calculate the hours for each month:\n\nFirst month hours = $200 \u00f7 $10/hour = 20 hours\n\nSecond month hours = $350 \u00f7 $10/hour = 35 hours\n\nTotal hours for two months = 20 + 35 = 55 hours\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to find the total hours Sam spent tutoring over two months.\n\nGiven information:\n- Sam earns $10 per hour\n- First month: $200\n- Second month: $150 more than the first month\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Second month earnings: $200 + $150 = $350\n\nNow I need to find the total hours:\n- Hours in first month: $200 \u00f7 $10/hour = 20 hours\n- Hours in second month: $350 \u00f7 $10/hour = 35 hours\n- Total hours for two months: 20 + 35 = 55 hours\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_perturbed": "55"}
