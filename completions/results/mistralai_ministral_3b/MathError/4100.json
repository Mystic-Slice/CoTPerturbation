{"id": 4100, "question": "A 26-mile circular marathon has four checkpoints inside it. The first is one mile from the start line, and the last checkpoint is one mile from the finish line. The checkpoints have equal spacing between them. How many miles apart are each of the consecutive checkpoints between the start-finish line?", "solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6 miles apart.\n#### 6", "clean_solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = 6 miles apart.", "perturbed_solution": "The checkpoints are 1 mile from the start and finish, so they are spaced along 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\nThere are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = 7 miles apart.", "answer": 6.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 6", "answer_solution_clean": "6", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 7", "answer_solution_perturbed": "7"}
