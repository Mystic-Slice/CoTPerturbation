According to the partial solution, 40% of the balls had holes, so:\n\n\\[ 40\\% \\text{ of } 100 \\text{ balls} = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 100 = 40 \\text{ balls} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many balls were left after removing the ones with holes:\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ balls} - 40 \\text{ balls} = 60 \\text{ balls} \\]\n\nNow, 20% of these remaining balls were overinflated and exploded.
