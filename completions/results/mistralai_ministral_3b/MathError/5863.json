{"id": 5863, "question": "Mary is making a spinach quiche. She takes 40 ounces of raw spinach and cooks it until it's 20% of its initial volume. If she mixes the spinach with 6 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of eggs, what is the total volume of the quiche?", "solution": "First find the cooked volume of the spinach: 40 ounces * 20% = <<40*20*.01=8>>8 ounces\nThen add that to the volume of the other ingredients to find the total volume: 8 ounces + 6 ounces + 4 ounces = <<8+6+4=18>>18 ounces\n#### 18", "clean_solution": "First find the cooked volume of the spinach: 40 ounces * 20% = 8 ounces", "perturbed_solution": "First find the cooked volume of the spinach: 40 ounces * 20% = 7 ounces", "answer": 8.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 8.4 ounces", "answer_solution_clean": "8.4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total volume of the quiche, we need to add the volume of the cooked spinach, the cream cheese, and the eggs.\n\nThe cooked volume of the spinach is 7 ounces (as calculated in the partial solution).\n\nThe volume of the cream cheese is 6 ounces.\n\nThe volume of the eggs is 4 ounces.\n\nSo, the total volume of the quiche is:\n\n7 ounces (spinach) + 6 ounces (cream cheese) + 4 ounces (eggs) = 17 ounces\n\nTherefore, the total volume of the quiche is 17 ounces.\n\n#### 17", "answer_solution_perturbed": "17"}
