{"id": 5507, "question": "John's weight bench can support 1000 pounds.  He wants to make sure to stay 20% under that weight for safety.  If he weighs 250 pounds how much weight can he put on the bar?", "solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=<<1000*.2=200>>200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=<<1000-200=800>>800 pounds\nThat means he can put 800-250=<<800-250=550>>550 pounds on the bar\n#### 550", "clean_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=800 pounds", "perturbed_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=291 pounds", "answer": 800.0, "perturbed_answer": 291.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 800", "answer_solution_clean": "800", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 291", "answer_solution_perturbed": "291"}
