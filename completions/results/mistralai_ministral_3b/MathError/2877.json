{"id": 2877, "question": "Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?", "solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = <<1500/75=20>>20\nThe second route will take 30 hours because 750 / 25 = <<750/25=30>>30\nThe fastest route takes 20 hours because 20 < 30\n#### 20", "clean_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20", "perturbed_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 48", "answer": 20.0, "perturbed_answer": 48.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "The second route will take 30 hours because 750 / 25 = 30\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the time it takes for each route, we need to divide the total distance by the average speed for each route.\n\nFor the first route:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{1500 \\text{ miles}}{75 \\text{ MPH}} = 20 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFor the second route:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{750 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ MPH}} = 30 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe fastest route is the one that takes less time, which is the first route.\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for Stuart's trip if he goes on the fastest route is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]", "answer_solution_perturbed": "invalid"}
