{"id": 957, "question": "A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?", "solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240", "clean_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.", "perturbed_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 639 coals.", "answer": 180.0, "perturbed_answer": 639.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "The grill burned 180 coals in total. Since it burns 15 coals every 20 minutes, we can calculate the total time by dividing the total number of coals by the number of coals burned per 20 minutes and then multiplying by 20.\n\nTotal time = (180 coals / 15 coals per 20 minutes) * 20 minutes\nTotal time = 12 * 20 minutes\nTotal time = 240 minutes\n\nSo, the grill ran for 240 minutes.\n\n#### 240", "answer_solution_clean": "240", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how long the grill ran, we need to determine how many sets of fifteen coals were burned to reach the total of 639 coals.
