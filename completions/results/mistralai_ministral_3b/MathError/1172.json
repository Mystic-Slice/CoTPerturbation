{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 9 wooden planks.", "answer": 50.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "Colbert's parents provide half of the planks, so they provide 200 / 2 = 100 planks.\nColbert's friends provide 20 planks.\nSo, the total number of planks from storage, parents, and friends is 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 planks.\nTherefore, Colbert needs to buy 200 - 170 = 30 planks from the store to finish his treehouse.", "answer_solution_clean": "invalid", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many planks Colbert needs to buy from the store, we first need to calculate the total number of planks he gets from his storage, parents, and friends.\n\nFrom his storage: 200 / 4 = 50 planks\nFrom his parents: 200 / 2 = 100 planks\nFrom his friends: 20 planks\n\nNow, we add these up to find the total number of planks he already has:\n50 (storage) + 100 (parents) + 20 (friends) = 170 planks\n\nFinally, we subtract this number from the total number of planks needed for the treehouse to find out how many he needs to buy from the store:\n200 (total needed) - 170 (already has) = 30 planks\n\nSo, Colbert needs to buy 30 planks of wood from the store to finish his treehouse.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
