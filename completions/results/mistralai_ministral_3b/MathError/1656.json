{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.

How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 30 feet long", "answer": 75.0, "perturbed_answer": 30.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "To calculate the cost of planting the trees along the fence, we need to determine how many trees Holly will need to cover the 75 feet of her fence. Since each tree will be 1.5 feet wide at maturity, we divide the total length of the fence by the width of one tree:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of trees} = \\frac{\\text{Total length of fence}}{\\text{Width of one tree}} = \\frac{75 \\text{ feet}}{1.5 \\text{ feet/tree}} = 50 \\text{ trees} \\]\n\nNow, we know that each tree costs $8.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of trees by the cost per tree:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Number of trees} \\times \\text{Cost per tree} = 50 \\times 8 = 400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to plant a row of the trees along her fence will be:\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_clean": "400", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.

How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?\n\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the fence from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can calculate the total length of the fence in feet as follows:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ yards} \\times 3 \\text{ feet/yard} = 75 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many trees Holly will need to cover the 75 feet of fence. Since each tree will be 1.5 feet wide at maturity, we can calculate the number of trees needed by dividing the total length of the fence by the width of one tree:\n\\[ \\frac{75 \\text{ feet}}{1.5 \\text{ feet/tree}} = 50 \\text{ trees} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the total cost of planting the trees, we multiply the number of trees by the cost per tree:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ trees} \\times \\$8.00/\\text{tree} = \\$400.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence will be:\n#### \\$400.00", "answer_solution_perturbed": "invalid"}
