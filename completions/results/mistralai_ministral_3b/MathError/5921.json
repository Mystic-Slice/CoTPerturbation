{"id": 5921, "question": "Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?", "solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.\nAt 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.\nAdding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.\nSince each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars\n#### 10", "clean_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 225 cents.", "perturbed_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 344 cents.", "answer": 225.0, "perturbed_answer": 344.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "To calculate the total cost of the calls, we need to add the cost of the local call to his father and the international call to his brother.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost of the call to his brother:\n- International call cost: 25 cents/minute * 31 minutes = 775 cents\n\nNow, add the cost of the local call to his father:\n- Total cost: 225 cents (local call) + 775 cents (international call) = 1000 cents\n\nConvert the total cost from cents to dollars:\n- 1000 cents = $10\n\nTherefore, Freddy spent $10 calling his family on New Year's Eve.\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_clean": "10", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To calculate the total cost of Freddy's calls, we need to add the cost of the local call to his father and the international call to his brother.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the international call to his brother:\n- International call cost: 25 cents/minute * 31 minutes = 775 cents\n\nNow, let's add the cost of the local call to his father:\n- Total cost: 344 cents (local call) + 775 cents (international call) = 1119 cents\n\nTo convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):\n- Total cost in dollars: 1119 cents / 100 = 11.19 dollars\n\nTherefore, Freddy spent 11.19 dollars calling his family on New Year's Eve.\n\n#### 11.19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "11.19"}
