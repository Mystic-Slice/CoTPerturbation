{"id": 7119, "question": "Jerry was asked by her mom to do grocery shopping. He needs to buy 2 liters of mustard oil that costs $13 per liter, 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta that costs $4 per pound, and 1  pound of pasta sauce that costs $5. If Jerry can keep the rest of the $50 after grocery shopping, how much money will he have?", "solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $<<13*2=26>>26.\nThe cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nSo, Jerry spent a total of $26 + $12 + $5 = $<<26+12+5=43>>43 for grocery shopping.\nThus, Jerry will have $50 - $43 = $<<50-43=7>>7 for himself.\n#### 7", "clean_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $26.", "perturbed_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $98.", "answer": 26.0, "perturbed_answer": 98.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "The cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $12.\nThe cost of 1 pound of pasta sauce is $5.\nThe total cost of the grocery shopping is $26 + $12 + $5 = $43.\nJerry will have $50 - $43 = $7 left after grocery shopping.", "answer_solution_clean": "invalid", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $12.\nThe cost of 1 pound of pasta sauce is $5.\nThe total cost of the grocery shopping is $98 + $12 + $5 = $115.\nJerry started with $50, so after grocery shopping, he will have $50 - $115 = -$65.\n\nSince Jerry cannot have a negative amount of money, he does not have any money left after grocery shopping.
