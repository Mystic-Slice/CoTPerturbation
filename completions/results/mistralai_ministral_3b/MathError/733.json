{"id": 733, "question": "Henry, John and Leo collected some seashells from the beach. Henry collected 11, Paul 24. If they initially collected 59 seashells in total and Leo gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid they met, how many do they have in total now?", "solution": "Henry and Paul collected a total of 11+24 = <<11+24=35>>35 seashells\nTo make a total of 59, Leo must have collected 59-35 = <<59-35=24>>24 seashells\nHe gave out a quarter of 24 seashells which is 24*(1/4) = <<24*(1/4)=6>>6 seashells\nThey are now left with 59-6 = <<59-6=53>>53 seashells\n#### 53", "clean_solution": "Henry and Paul collected a total of 11+24 = 35 seashells", "perturbed_solution": "Henry and Paul collected a total of 11+24 = 70 seashells", "answer": 35.0, "perturbed_answer": 70.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 35", "answer_solution_clean": "35", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 59", "answer_solution_perturbed": "59"}
