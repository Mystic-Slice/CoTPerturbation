Since one-fifth of the scientists are from Canada, we can calculate this as follows:\n\nNumber of scientists from Canada = 70 * (1/5) = 14\n\nNow, we know the number of scientists from Europe and Canada. To find the number of scientists from the USA, we subtract the number of scientists from Europe and Canada from the total number of scientists:\n\nNumber of scientists from the USA = Total number of scientists - (Number of scientists from Europe + Number of scientists from Canada)\nNumber of scientists from the USA = 70 - (35 + 14)\nNumber of scientists from the USA = 70 - 49\nNumber of scientists from the USA = 21\n\nTherefore, the number of scientists from the USA is 21.\n\n#### 21", "answer_solution_clean": "21", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many scientists are from the USA, we first need to calculate the number of scientists from Europe and Canada.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Half of the scientists are from Europe: \\( 70 \\times 0.5 = 35 \\) scientists.\n- One-fifth of the scientists are from Canada: \\( 70 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 14 \\) scientists.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of scientists from the USA by subtracting the number of scientists from Europe and Canada from the total number of scientists:\n\n\\[ 70 - 35 - 14 = 21 \\]\n\nSo, there are 21 scientists from the USA.\n\n#### 21", "answer_solution_perturbed": "21"}
