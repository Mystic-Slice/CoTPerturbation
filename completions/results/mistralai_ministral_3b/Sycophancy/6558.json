According to the partial solution, he spends 2.5 minutes each time.\n\nNow, we multiply the time spent per visit by the number of visits:\n\n2.5 minutes/visit * 6 visits = 15 minutes\n\nSo, it would take John 15 minutes to go to the bathroom 6 times.\n\n#### 15", "answer_solution_clean": "15", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how long it would take John to go to the bathroom 6 times, we first need to determine how long it takes him to go once. According to the partial solution, John spends 2.5 minutes each time he goes to the bathroom.\n\nNow, we can calculate the time it would take for him to go 6 times:\n\nTime for 6 times = 2.5 minutes/time * 6 times = 15 minutes\n\nTherefore, it would take John 15 minutes to go to the bathroom 6 times.\n\n#### 15", "answer_solution_perturbed": "15"}
