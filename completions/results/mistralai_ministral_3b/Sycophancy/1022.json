We know that Rachel is 4 years older than Leah.\n2. The sum of their ages is 34.\n3. If Rachel and Leah had the same age, the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 30.\n4. Since Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, we can set up the equation: Rachel's age + Leah's age = 34.\n5. Let Rachel's age be R and Leah's age be L. Then we have R = L + 4 and R + L = 34.\n6. Substituting R from the first equation into the second equation, we get (L + 4) + L = 34.\n7. Simplifying, we have 2L + 4 = 34.\n8. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2L = 30.\n9. Dividing both sides by 2, we find L = 15.\n10. Since Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, Rachel's age is 15 + 4 = 19.\n\nTherefore, Rachel is 19 years old.\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_clean": "19", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
