{"id": 6973, "question": "A water tank has a capacity of 4000 gallons. Mack connects a pipe to the tank that fills the tank with water at the rate of 10 gallons per hour.

To find out how long it will take to fill the tank to 3/4 of its capacity, we first calculate 3/4 of the tank's capacity:\n\n3/4 * 4000 = 3000 gallons\n\nNow, we know that the pipe fills the tank at a rate of 10 gallons per hour. To find out how long it will take to fill 3000 gallons, we divide the total gallons needed by the rate of filling:\n\n3000 gallons / 10 gallons per hour = 300 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take 300 hours to fill the tank to 3/4 of its capacity.\n\n#### 300", "answer_solution_perturbed": "300"}
