He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.\n\nThen, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters. So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 540\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `3 * 60 = 180 meters` to modify. I will change the unit from meters to centimeters. I will change the number 180 to 18000 because from the given conversionFactors, it is known that 1 meter = 100 centimeter.

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is speed * time, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.\n\nNext, he spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is again speed * time, so he drives 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\nFinally, he spends the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is speed * time, so he drives 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nSo, in total, during the 4 hours of his return trip, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles towards home.\n\nHowever, he was initially 180 miles away from home. So, at the end of those 4 hours, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours` to modify. I will change the number 1.5 to 90 because from the given conversionFactors, it is known that 1 hour = 60 minutes. I will replace the unit hours with minutes.

Since her car gets 25 miles per gallon:\n\nGallons needed = Total distance / Car's fuel efficiency\nGallons needed = 50 miles / 25 miles per gallon = 2 gallons\n\nFinally, we calculate the cost of the gas:\n\nCost of gas = Gallons needed * Cost per gallon\nCost of gas = 2 gallons * $2.50 per gallon = $5.00\n\nTherefore, Carla will have to spend $5.00 on gas for her trip.\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_clean": "5", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To calculate the total distance Carla needs to drive, we first need to find the distance between soccer practice and home, which is twice the distance from the school to soccer practice. According to the partial solution, this distance is 38.6248 kilometers. However, since the distances given in the problem are in miles, we should convert the distance between soccer practice and home to miles.\n\n1 kilometer is approximately 0.621371 miles. So, the distance between soccer practice and home in miles is:\n\\[ 38.6248 \\text{ km} \\times 0.621371 \\text{ miles/km} = 24.0000 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, let's add up all the distances Carla needs to drive:\n- To the grocery store: 8 miles\n- To pick up her kids from school: 6 miles\n- To drop her kids off at soccer practice: 12 miles\n- To get everyone home again: 24 miles\n\nTotal distance = 8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 50 miles\n\nCarla's car gets 25 miles per gallon. To find out how many gallons of gas she will need, we divide the total distance by the car's fuel efficiency:\n\\[ \\frac{50 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ miles/gallon}} = 2 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nThe cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon. To find out how much Carla will spend on gas, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ gallons} \\times $2.50/\\text{gallon} = $5.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Carla will have to spend $5.00 on gas for her trip.\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_perturbed": "5"}
