{"id": 6280, "question": "Janet buys a multi-flavor pack of cheese sticks. 15 of the sticks are cheddar, 30 are mozzarella, and 45 are pepperjack. If Janet picks a cheese stick at random, what is the percentage chance it will be pepperjack?", "solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = <<15+30+45=90>>90 cheese sticks\nThen divide the number of pepperjack sticks by the total number of cheese sticks and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 45 pepperjack sticks / 90 cheese sticks * 100% = 50%\n#### 50", "clean_solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 90 cheese sticks", "perturbed_solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 90 cheese sticks\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the percentage chance that Janet picks a pepperjack cheese stick, we need to calculate the proportion of pepperjack cheese sticks out of the total number of cheese sticks.\n\nThe total number of cheese sticks is 90, and there are 45 pepperjack cheese sticks.\n\nThe percentage chance of picking a pepperjack cheese stick is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of pepperjack cheese sticks}}{\\text{Total number of cheese sticks}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{45}{90} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = 50 \\]\n\nSo, the percentage chance that Janet picks a pepperjack cheese stick is 50%.\n\n#### 50", "answer_solution_clean": "50", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 50", "answer_solution_perturbed": "50"}
