{"id": 1022, "question": "Rachel is 4 years older than Leah. If the sum of their ages is 34, how old is Rachel?", "solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = <<34-4=30>>30.\nSo Leah would be 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 years old.\nHence, Rachel is 15 + 4 = <<15+4=19>>19 years old.\n#### 19", "clean_solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 30.", "perturbed_solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 30.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's continue and complete the solution to the given problem.\n\nGiven that Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, we can express their ages as follows:\n- Rachel's age = Leah's age + 4\n\nWe are also given that the sum of their ages is 34. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n- Rachel's age + Leah's age = 34\n\nSubstituting Rachel's age from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n- (Leah's age + 4) + Leah's age = 34\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n- 2 * Leah's age + 4 = 34\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get:\n- 2 * Leah's age = 30\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we find Leah's age:\n- Leah's age = 15\n\nNow, we can find Rachel's age by adding 4 to Leah's age:\n- Rachel's age = Leah's age + 4\n- Rachel's age = 15 + 4\n- Rachel's age = 19\n\nTherefore, Rachel is 19 years old.\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_clean": "19", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 17", "answer_solution_perturbed": "17"}
