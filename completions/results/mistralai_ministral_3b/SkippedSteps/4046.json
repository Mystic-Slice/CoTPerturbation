{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many hours Sam spent on tutoring for two months, we first need to calculate the total amount he earned over the two months.\n\nFor the first month, he earned $200.\nFor the second month, he earned $200 + $150 = $350.\n\nSo, the total amount earned over the two months is $200 + $350 = $550.\n\nSince Sam earns $10 an hour, we can find the total number of hours he spent tutoring by dividing the total amount earned by his hourly rate.\n\nTotal hours = Total amount earned / Hourly rate\nTotal hours = $550 / $10\nTotal hours = 55\n\nTherefore, Sam spent 55 hours on tutoring for two months.\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many hours Sam spent on tutoring for two months, we need to calculate the total earnings for both months and then divide by his hourly rate.\n\nFor the first month, Sam earned $200.\nFor the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\n\nTotal earnings for two months = $200 (first month) + $350 (second month) = $550.\n\nSam earns $10 an hour, so the total hours he spent on tutoring for two months is:\n\nTotal hours = Total earnings / Hourly rate\nTotal hours = $550 / $10\nTotal hours = 55\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n#### 55", "answer_solution_perturbed": "55"}
