{"id": 5707, "question": "Max has a collection of stamps in three colors: 20 red stamps, 80 blue stamps and 7 yellow ones. He is trying to sell the whole collection. He already sold 20 red stamps for the price of $1.1 for each stamp and 80 blue stamps for the price of $0.8 for each stamp.

To earn a total of $100, he needs to earn $100 - $22 - $64 = $14 from the yellow stamps.\n\nHe has 7 yellow stamps to sell. To find the price per yellow stamp, we divide the total amount he needs to earn from the yellow stamps by the number of yellow stamps:\n\nPrice per yellow stamp = $14 / 7 = $2\n\nTherefore, Max needs to set the price for each yellow stamp at $2 to earn a total of $100 from the whole sale.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out the price Max needs to set for each yellow stamp to earn a total of $100 from the whole sale, we first need to calculate the total amount he has already earned from the red and blue stamps.\n\nFrom the red stamps:\n20 red stamps * $1.1 per stamp = $22\n\nFrom the blue stamps:\n80 blue stamps * $0.8 per stamp = $64\n\nNow, we add the earnings from the red and blue stamps:\n$22 (from red stamps) + $64 (from blue stamps) = $86\n\nMax wants to earn a total of $100 from the whole sale.
