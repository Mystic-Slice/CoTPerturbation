{"id": 5462, "question": "Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?", "solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = <<3*8=24>>24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = <<3*6=18>>18 miles\nNow add the number of miles both people skated to find the total distance between them: 18 miles + 24 miles = <<18+24=42>>42 miles\n#### 42", "clean_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles", "perturbed_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 24", "answer_solution_clean": "24", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
