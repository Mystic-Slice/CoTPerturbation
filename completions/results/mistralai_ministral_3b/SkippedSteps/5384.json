Calculate the number of apples produced in the second season:\n   - The tree produced 20% fewer fruits in the second season compared to the first season.\n   - 20% of 200 apples is 40 apples.\n   - Therefore, the number of apples in the second season is 200 - 40 = 160 apples.\n\n2. Calculate the number of apples produced in the third season:\n   - The tree's fruit production doubled in the third season compared to the second season.\n   - Therefore, the number of apples in the third season is 160 * 2 = 320 apples.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of apples produced over the three seasons:\n   - Total apples = First season + Second season + Third season\n   - Total apples = 200 + 160 + 320 = 680 apples.\n\n#### 680", "answer_solution_clean": "680", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The tree produced 200 - 40 = 160 apples in the second season.
