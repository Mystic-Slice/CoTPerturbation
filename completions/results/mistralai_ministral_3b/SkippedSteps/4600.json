{"id": 4600, "question": "Nick is trying to raise money for a charity. He is selling candy bars for $5. He is also selling chocolate oranges for $10. He wants to raise $1000.

How many candy bars does Nick need to sell to reach his goal?", "solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $<<20*10=200>>200 from the chocolate oranges.\nThis means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800.\nHe needs to sell a total of $800 / $5 = <<800/5=160>>160 candy bars to reach his goal.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $200 from the chocolate oranges.", "perturbed_solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $200 from the chocolate oranges.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "Nick has made $200 from the chocolate oranges. He needs to raise a total of $1000. So, he still needs to raise $1000 - $200 = $800.\n\nEach candy bar is sold for $5. To find out how many candy bars Nick needs to sell to raise $800, we divide the remaining amount by the price of one candy bar:\n\n$800 / $5 = 160 candy bars.\n\nTherefore, Nick needs to sell 160 candy bars to reach his goal. #### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Nick has made $200 from the chocolate oranges.
