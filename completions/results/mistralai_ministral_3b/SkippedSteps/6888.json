{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how much more a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale, we first determine the cost per pint without the sale. We know that the supermarket made $324 without the sale for the same number of pints (54 pints).\n\nSo, the cost per pint without the sale is:\n\\[ \\frac{324}{54} = 6 \\]\n\nThe cost per pint on sale is $4. Therefore, the additional cost per pint when not on sale is:\n\\[ 6 - 4 = 2 \\]\n\nThus, a pint of strawberries costs $2 more when not on sale.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 324 / 54 = 6", "answer_solution_perturbed": "324"}
