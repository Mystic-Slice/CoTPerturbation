{"id": 4275, "question": "Scott, Mary, and Ken committed to raising $4,000 for their local children\u2019s cancer hospital. Right now, Mary\u2019s collection is five times what Ken has, but three times Scott\u2019s funds. If Ken has $600, by how much have the three exceeded their goal?", "solution": "Mary has collected 5 * $600 = $<<5*600=3000>>3000\nScott therefore has $3000 / 3 = $<<3000/3=1000>>1000\nAll together, they have raised $3000 + $1000 + $600 = $<<3000+1000+600=4600>>4600\nThey have therefore exceeded their goal by $4600 - $4000 = $<<4600-4000=600>>600\n#### 600", "clean_solution": "Mary has collected 5 * $600 = $3000", "perturbed_solution": "Mary has collected 5 * $600 = $3000\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "Mary has collected 5 * $600 = $3000\n\nScott's collection is one-third of Mary's, so Scott has collected $3000 / 3 = $1000.\n\nThe total amount collected by Scott, Mary, and Ken is $600 (Ken) + $3000 (Mary) + $1000 (Scott) = $4600.\n\nThe goal was to raise $4000, so they have exceeded their goal by $4600 - $4000 = $600.\n\n#### 600", "answer_solution_clean": "600", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Mary has collected $3000.\n\nScott's collection is three times Ken's funds, so Scott has collected 3 * $600 = $1800.\n\nThe total amount collected by the three is $3000 (Mary) + $1800 (Scott) + $600 (Ken) = $5400.\n\nThe goal was to raise $4000, so they have exceeded their goal by $5400 - $4000 = $1400.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n#### 1400", "answer_solution_perturbed": "1400"}
