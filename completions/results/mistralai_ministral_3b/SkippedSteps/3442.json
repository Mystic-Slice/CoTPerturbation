{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\n\nHe will earn 8 cakes * $2.5 per cake = $20 from the cakes.\n\nHe can bake 2 pounds / (1/5) pounds per cupcake = 10 cupcakes from the remaining 2 pounds of flour.\n\nHe will earn 10 cupcakes * $1 per cupcake = $10 from the cupcakes.\n\nIn total, Gary will earn $20 + $10 = $30 from the bake sale.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nHe will earn 8 * $2.5 = $20 from the cakes.\nHe will earn 10 * $1 = $10 from the cupcakes.\nTherefore, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $30.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
