{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "Colbert's parents provide half of the planks, so that's 200 / 2 = 100 planks.\nColbert's friends provide 20 planks.\nSo far, Colbert has 50 (from storage) + 100 (from parents) + 20 (from friends) = 170 planks.\nHe needs 200 planks in total, so he needs to buy 200 - 170 = 30 planks from the store.", "answer_solution_clean": "invalid", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Colbert's parents provide half of the planks, which is 200 / 2 = 100 planks.\nColbert's friends provide 20 planks.\nSo, the total number of planks from storage and parents is 50 (from storage) + 100 (from parents) = 150 planks.\nThe total number of planks needed is 200, so the number of planks Colbert needs to buy from the store is 200 - 150 = 50 planks.\n\n#### 50", "answer_solution_perturbed": "50"}
