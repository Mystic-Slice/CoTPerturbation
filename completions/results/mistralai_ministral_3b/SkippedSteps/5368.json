Pepperoni: 30 pieces\n2. Ham: 30 * 2 = 60 pieces\n3. Sausage: 30 + 12 = 42 pieces\n\nNow, we add up all the pieces of meat:\nTotal pieces of meat = 30 (pepperoni) + 60 (ham) + 42 (sausage) = 132 pieces\n\nSince the pizza is cut into 6 slices and the meat is distributed evenly, we divide the total number of pieces of meat by the number of slices:\nPieces of meat per slice = 132 / 6 = 22 pieces\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n#### 22", "answer_solution_perturbed": "22"}
