{"id": 5921, "question": "Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?", "solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.\nAt 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.\nAdding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.\nSince each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars\n#### 10", "clean_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 225 cents.", "perturbed_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 225 cents.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "To calculate the total cost of the calls, we need to add the cost of the local call to the cost of the international call.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the international call:\n- The cost per minute for the international call is 25 cents.\n- Freddy talked to his brother for 31 minutes.\n- So, the cost for the international call is 25 cents/minute * 31 minutes = 775 cents.\n\nNow, let's add the cost of the local call:\n- The cost per minute for the local call is 5 cents.\n- Freddy talked to his father for 45 minutes.\n- So, the cost for the local call is 5 cents/minute * 45 minutes = 225 cents.\n\nFinally, let's add the costs of both calls to find the total cost:\n- Total cost = Cost of local call + Cost of international call\n- Total cost = 225 cents + 775 cents = 1000 cents.\n\nSince 100 cents equal 1 dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:\n- Total cost in dollars = 1000 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 10 dollars.\n\nTherefore, Freddy spent 10 dollars calling his family on New Year's Eve.\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_clean": "10", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To calculate the total cost of the calls, we need to add the cost of the local call to his father and the international call to his brother.\n\nCost of local call to father = 5 cents/minute * 45 minutes = 225 cents\nCost of international call to brother = 25 cents/minute * 31 minutes = 775 cents\n\nTotal cost in cents = 225 cents + 775 cents = 1000 cents\n\nTo convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar).\n\nTotal cost in dollars = 1000 cents / 100 = 10 dollars\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n#### 10", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10"}
