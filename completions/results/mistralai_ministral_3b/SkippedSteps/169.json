{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "To calculate the new amount of grapes Borris needs after increasing his production by twenty percent, we first find the increased amount for six months and then double it to get the annual amount.\n\n1.
