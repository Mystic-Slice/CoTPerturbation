{"id": 4597, "question": "Mason is mixing up some salad dressing. He takes a bowl that holds 150 ml and fills it 2/3rds with oil and 1/3rd with vinegar. The oil weighs 5 g/ml and the vinegar weighs 4 g/ml. How many grams does the salad dressing weigh?", "solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = <<150*2/3=100>>100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = <<150*1/3=50>>50 ml\nNow find the weight of the oil by multiplying the volume by the weight/volume ratio: 100 ml * 5 g/ml = <<100*5=500>>500 g\nDo the same procedure with the weight and weight/volume ratio of the vinegar to find its weight: 50 ml * 4 g/ml = <<50*4=200>>200 g\nNow add the weight of the oil and the vinegar to find the weight of the salad dressing: 500 g + 200 g = <<500+200=700>>700 g\n#### 700", "clean_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 50 ml", "perturbed_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 50 ml\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-3b", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total weight of the salad dressing, we need to calculate the weight of the oil and the vinegar separately and then add them together.\n\nFirst, calculate the weight of the oil:\nWeight of oil = Volume of oil * Density of oil\nWeight of oil = 100 ml * 5 g/ml\nWeight of oil = 500 g\n\nNext, calculate the weight of the vinegar:\nWeight of vinegar = Volume of vinegar * Density of vinegar\nWeight of vinegar = 50 ml * 4 g/ml\nWeight of vinegar = 200 g\n\nNow, add the weight of the oil and the vinegar to get the total weight of the salad dressing:\nTotal weight = Weight of oil + Weight of vinegar\nTotal weight = 500 g + 200 g\nTotal weight = 700 g\n\n#### 700", "answer_solution_clean": "700", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total weight of the salad dressing, we need to calculate the weight of the oil and the vinegar separately and then add them together.\n\nFirst, calculate the weight of the oil:\nWeight of oil = Volume of oil * Density of oil\nWeight of oil = 100 ml * 5 g/ml = 500 g\n\nNext, calculate the weight of the vinegar:\nWeight of vinegar = Volume of vinegar * Density of vinegar\nWeight of vinegar = 50 ml * 4 g/ml = 200 g\n\nNow, add the weight of the oil and the vinegar to get the total weight of the salad dressing:\nTotal weight = Weight of oil + Weight of vinegar\nTotal weight = 500 g + 200 g = 700 g\n\nTherefore, the salad dressing weighs 700 grams.", "answer_solution_perturbed": "invalid"}
