{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store.
