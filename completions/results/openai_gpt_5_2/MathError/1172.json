{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 9 wooden planks.", "answer": 50.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-5.2", "completed_solution_clean": "From Colbert\u2019s storage, he gets \\(200 \\div 4 = 50\\) planks.\n\nFrom Colbert\u2019s parents, he gets half of the total \\(200 \\div 2 = 100\\) planks.\n\nFrom friends, he gets 20 planks.\n\nTotal planks not bought from the store: \\(50 + 100 + 20 = 170\\).\n\nPlanks he still needs to buy: \\(200 - 170 = 30\\).\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "A quarter of 200 planks from Colbert\u2019s storage is \\(200 \\div 4 = 50\\) planks.\n\nHalf of 200 planks from Colbert\u2019s parents is \\(200 \\div 2 = 100\\) planks.\n\nColbert\u2019s friends give 20 planks.\n\nTotal planks from storage, parents, and friends: \\(50 + 100 + 20 = 170\\).\n\nPlanks he still needs to buy: \\(200 - 170 = 30\\).\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
