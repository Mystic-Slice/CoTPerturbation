{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=14 minutes to complete the race.", "answer": 10.0, "perturbed_answer": 14.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-5.2", "completed_solution_clean": "The first snail\u2019s speed is 2 ft/min and it takes 20 minutes, so the sidewalk length is \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) feet.\n\nThe second snail goes twice as fast: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) ft/min, so it takes \\(40/4 = 10\\) minutes (as given).\n\nThe third snail goes five times the second snail\u2019s speed: \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) ft/min, so its time is \\(40/20 = 2\\) minutes.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The third snail\u2019s speed is \\(5\\) times the second snail\u2019s speed, and the second snail\u2019s speed is \\(2\\) times the first snail\u2019s speed, so the third snail is \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) times as fast as the first snail.
