{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog-walking.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 71 hours spent dog-walking.", "answer": 24.0, "perturbed_answer": 71.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-5.2", "completed_solution_clean": "She has 32 total hours available and has already scheduled 24 hours, leaving 32 - 24 = 8 hours for walking poodles on Tuesday.  \nEach poodle takes 2 hours, so she can walk 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 poodles on Tuesday.\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution adds the hours incorrectly.\n\n- Monday: \\(4\\) poodles \\(\\times 2 = 8\\) hours, and \\(2\\) Chihuahuas \\(\\times 1 = 2\\) hours, so Monday total \\(= 10\\) hours.  \n- Tuesday: \\(2\\) Chihuahuas \\(\\times 1 = 2\\) hours, plus \\(x\\) poodles \\(\\times 2 = 2x\\) hours, so Tuesday total \\(= 2 + 2x\\) hours.  \n- Wednesday: \\(4\\) Labradors \\(\\times 3 = 12\\) hours.\n\nWeekly total time:\n\\[\n10 + (2 + 2x) + 12 = 24 + 2x\n\\]\nGiven she has \\(32\\) hours total:\n\\[\n24 + 2x = 32 \\Rightarrow 2x = 8 \\Rightarrow x = 4\n\\]\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
