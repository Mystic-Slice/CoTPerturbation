{"id": 6280, "question": "Janet buys a multi-flavor pack of cheese sticks. 15 of the sticks are cheddar, 30 are mozzarella, and 45 are pepperjack. If Janet picks a cheese stick at random, what is the percentage chance it will be pepperjack?", "solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = <<15+30+45=90>>90 cheese sticks\nThen divide the number of pepperjack sticks by the total number of cheese sticks and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 45 pepperjack sticks / 90 cheese sticks * 100% = 50%\n#### 50", "clean_solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 90 cheese sticks", "perturbed_solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 90 cheese sticks\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-5.2", "completed_solution_clean": "Janet has 90 cheese sticks total.
