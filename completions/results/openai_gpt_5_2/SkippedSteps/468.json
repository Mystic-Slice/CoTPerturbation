{"id": 468, "question": "A shopping center sells T-shirts at $8 each, a sweater at $18,  and a jacket at $80. The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. The sales tax is 5%.  Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, four sweaters, and five jackets for his children. How much does Kevin have to pay for all the items, including the sales tax?", "solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $480 = $<<5/100*480=24>>24.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $<<480+24=504>>504. including the sales tax.\n#### 504", "clean_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $400.", "perturbed_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $400.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-5.2", "completed_solution_clean": "The jacket is discounted by 10%, so each jacket costs $80 \u00d7 0.90 = $72.  \nFive jackets cost 5 \u00d7 $72 = $360.\n\nSubtotal for all items: $48 + $72 + $360 = $480.  \nSales tax: 5% of $480 = 0.05 \u00d7 $480 = $24.  \nTotal amount to pay: $480 + $24 = $504.\n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_clean": "504", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The jackets are on sale for 10% off, so each $80 jacket costs $80 \u00d7 0.90 = $72, and five jackets cost 5 \u00d7 $72 = $360.  \nSubtotal before tax = $48 + $72 + $360 = $480.  \nSales tax = 5% of $480 = 0.05 \u00d7 $480 = $24.  \nTotal cost including tax = $480 + $24 = $504.\n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_perturbed": "504"}
