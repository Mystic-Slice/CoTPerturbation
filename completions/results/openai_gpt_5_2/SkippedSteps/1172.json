{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "openai/gpt-5.2", "completed_solution_clean": "From Colbert\u2019s parents, he gets half of 200 planks: 200 / 2 = 100 planks.  \nFrom his friends, he gets 20 planks.\n\nTotal planks he already has: 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 planks.  \nPlanks he still needs to buy: 200 - 170 = 30 planks.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Colbert\u2019s parents provide half of the 200 planks: 200 / 2 = 100 planks.  \nColbert\u2019s friends provide 20 planks.  \nTotal planks not bought from the store: 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 planks.  \nPlanks to buy from the store: 200 - 170 = 30.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
