The partial solution correctly calculates the number of four-leaved clovers:\n   20% of 500 clovers = 0.20 * 500 = 100 four-leaved clovers.\n\n2.

The partial solution incorrectly calculates the number of four-leaved clovers. The correct calculation should be:\n   - 20% of 500 clovers have four leaves.\n   - Number of four-leaved clovers = 20% of 500 = 0.20 * 500 = 100.\n\n2.
