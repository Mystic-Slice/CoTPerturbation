According to the problem, Emery reads five times as fast as Serena, meaning Emery takes \\( \\frac{S}{5} \\) days to read the book.\n\nGiven that Emery takes 20 days to read the book, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{S}{5} = 20\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\nS = 20 \\times 5 = 100 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nWait, this contradicts the partial solution provided. Let me correct this.\n\nThe partial solution states that Emery reads five times as fast as Serena, meaning Emery takes \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the time Serena takes. If Emery takes 20 days, Serena would take \\( 20 \\times 5 = 100 \\) days.\n\nNow, to find the average number of days the two take to read the book:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Emery's days} + \\text{Serena's days}}{2} = \\frac{20 + 100}{2} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60\n\\]\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_perturbed": "60"}
