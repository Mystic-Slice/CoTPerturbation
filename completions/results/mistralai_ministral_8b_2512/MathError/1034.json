{"id": 1034, "question": "When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?", "solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 cups of cream cheese.\nShe uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\nFor each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eggs.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.", "perturbed_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 10 times her ratio.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 10.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's continue the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. The ratio of sugar to cream cheese is **1:4**. Since Betty used **2 cups of sugar**, the amount of cream cheese used is:\n   **2 cups sugar \u00d7 4 = 8 cups cream cheese**.\n\n2. The ratio of vanilla to cream cheese is **1 teaspoon vanilla per 2 cups cream cheese**. So, for **8 cups cream cheese**, the amount of vanilla used is:\n   **8 cups cream cheese \u00f7 2 = 4 teaspoons vanilla**.\n\n3. The ratio of eggs to vanilla is **2 eggs per 1 teaspoon vanilla**. Therefore, for **4 teaspoons vanilla**, the number of eggs used is:\n   **4 teaspoons vanilla \u00d7 2 = 8 eggs**.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Ratio of sugar to cream cheese**: 1 part sugar to 4 parts cream cheese.\n   - If Betty used 2 cups of sugar, then the amount of cream cheese used is:\n     \\( 2 \\text{ cups sugar} \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ cups cream cheese} \\).\n\n2. **Ratio of vanilla to cream cheese**: 1 teaspoon of vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese.\n   - For 8 cups of cream cheese, the amount of vanilla used is:\n     \\( \\frac{8 \\text{ cups cream cheese}}{2} = 4 \\text{ teaspoons vanilla} \\).\n\n3. **Ratio of eggs to vanilla**: 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon of vanilla.\n   - For 4 teaspoons of vanilla, the number of eggs used is:\n     \\( 4 \\text{ teaspoons vanilla} \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ eggs} \\).\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
