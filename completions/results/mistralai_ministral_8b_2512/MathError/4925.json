Bernie sells half of his collection, which is 9 postcards (not 4, since 18 * 0.5 = 9).\n   - He sells 9 postcards at $15 each, so the total money earned is:\n     9 * 15 = $135.\n\n2. Bernie spends all the earned money ($135) to buy new postcards at $5 each.\n   - The number of new postcards he can buy is:\n     135 / 5 = 27 postcards.\n\n3. Initially, Bernie had 18 postcards and sold 9 of them, so he has:\n   18 - 9 = 9 postcards left.\n\n4. After buying the new postcards, Bernie has:\n   9 (remaining) + 27 (new) = 36 postcards.\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_perturbed": "36"}
