{"id": 957, "question": "A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?", "solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240", "clean_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.", "perturbed_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 639 coals.", "answer": 180.0, "perturbed_answer": 639.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how long the grill ran, we need to determine the time it takes to burn 180 coals at a rate of 15 coals every 20 minutes.\n\n1.
