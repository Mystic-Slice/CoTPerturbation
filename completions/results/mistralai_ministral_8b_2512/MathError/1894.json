{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog-walking.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 71 hours spent dog-walking.", "answer": 24.0, "perturbed_answer": 71.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Let \\( x \\) be the number of poodles Charlotte walks on Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, she spends \\( x \\) poodles * 2 hours = \\( 2x \\) hours walking poodles.\n\nThe total time spent walking dogs over the week is:\n\\[ 8 + 2 + 2x + 2 + 12 = 24 + 2x \\]\n\nWe know the total time available is 32 hours, so we set up the equation:\n\\[ 24 + 2x = 32 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 2x = 32 - 24 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 8 \\]\n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution provided seems to have an inconsistency because it sums up to 24 hours (8 + 2 + 2 + 12) instead of 71 hours, and the total time for the week should be 32 hours. Let's correct and complete the solution:\n\n1. Calculate the time spent on Monday:\n   - Poodles: 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours\n   - Chihuahuas: 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours\n   - Total for Monday: 8 + 2 = 10 hours\n\n2. Calculate the time spent on Wednesday:\n   - Labradors: 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours\n\n3. Calculate the time spent on Tuesday:\n   - Chihuahuas: 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours\n   - Let the number of poodles walked on Tuesday be \\( x \\).\n   - Time spent on poodles on Tuesday: \\( x \\) * 2 hours\n\n4. Total time for the week:\n   - Monday: 10 hours\n   - Tuesday: 2 + 2x hours\n   - Wednesday: 12 hours\n   - Total: 10 + 2 + 2x + 12 = 24 + 2x hours\n\n5.
