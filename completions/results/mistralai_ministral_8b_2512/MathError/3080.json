{"id": 3080, "question": "Tony has two fish. Every year, his parents buy him two more, but one of them dies. How many fish will he have in five years?", "solution": "Each year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 - 1 = <<2-1=1>>1\nIn five years, he will have 5 more fish because 5 x 1 = <<5*1=5>>5\nIn five years he will have 7 fish because 2 + 5 = <<2+5=7>>7\n#### 7", "clean_solution": "Each year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 - 1 = 1\nIn five years, he will have 5 more fish because 5 x 1 = 5\nIn five years he will have 7 fish because 2 + 5 = 7", "perturbed_solution": "Each year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 - 1 = 1\nIn five years, he will have 5 more fish because 5 x 1 = 5\nIn five years he will have 7 fish because 2 + 5 = 9", "answer": 7.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 7", "answer_solution_clean": "7", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution incorrectly adds the net increase to the initial number of fish. Let's correct it:\n\n1. **Initial number of fish**: 2\n2. **Net increase per year**: 1 (since 2 are added and 1 dies)\n3. **Total net increase over 5 years**: 5 x 1 = 5\n4. **Total number of fish after 5 years**: 2 (initial) + 5 (increase) = 7\n\n#### 7", "answer_solution_perturbed": "7"}
