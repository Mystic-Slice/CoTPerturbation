{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 9 wooden planks.", "answer": 50.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's continue the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. From Colbert\u2019s storage: 50 wooden planks (as calculated in the partial solution).\n2. From Colbert\u2019s parents: Half of the total planks, so 200 wooden planks / 2 = 100 wooden planks.\n3. From Colbert\u2019s friends: 20 wooden planks (given in the question).\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of planks Colbert already has from these sources:\n50 (storage) + 100 (parents) + 20 (friends) = 170 wooden planks.\n\nThe total number of planks needed is 200. Therefore, the number of planks Colbert needs to buy from the store is:\n200 - 170 = 30 wooden planks.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **From Colbert\u2019s storage**: 200 wooden planks / 4 = **50 wooden planks** (not 9, as the partial solution incorrectly states).\n2. **From Colbert\u2019s parents**: Half of the planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, so 200 / 2 = **100 wooden planks**.\n3. **From Colbert\u2019s friends**: 20 wooden planks.\n4. **Total planks accounted for so far**:\n   50 (storage) + 100 (parents) + 20 (friends) = **170 wooden planks**.\n\n5. **Remaining planks to buy from the store**:\n   200 (total needed) - 170 (accounted for) = **30 wooden planks**.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
