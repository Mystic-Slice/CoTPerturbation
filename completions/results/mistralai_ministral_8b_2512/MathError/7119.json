{"id": 7119, "question": "Jerry was asked by her mom to do grocery shopping. He needs to buy 2 liters of mustard oil that costs $13 per liter, 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta that costs $4 per pound, and 1  pound of pasta sauce that costs $5. If Jerry can keep the rest of the $50 after grocery shopping, how much money will he have?", "solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $<<13*2=26>>26.\nThe cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nSo, Jerry spent a total of $26 + $12 + $5 = $<<26+12+5=43>>43 for grocery shopping.\nThus, Jerry will have $50 - $43 = $<<50-43=7>>7 for himself.\n#### 7", "clean_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $26.", "perturbed_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $98.", "answer": 26.0, "perturbed_answer": 98.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's continue the solution step-by-step:\n\n1.
