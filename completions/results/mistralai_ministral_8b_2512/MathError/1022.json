{"id": 1022, "question": "Rachel is 4 years older than Leah. If the sum of their ages is 34, how old is Rachel?", "solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = <<34-4=30>>30.\nSo Leah would be 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 years old.\nHence, Rachel is 15 + 4 = <<15+4=19>>19 years old.\n#### 19", "clean_solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 30.", "perturbed_solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 68.", "answer": 30.0, "perturbed_answer": 68.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the partial solution as a starting point.\n\n1. Let Leah's age be **L**.\n2. Since Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, Rachel's age is **L + 4**.\n3. The sum of their ages is 34, so we can write the equation:\n   **L + (L + 4) = 34**\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   **2L + 4 = 34**\n5. Subtract 4 from both sides:\n   **2L = 30**\n6. Divide both sides by 2:\n   **L = 15**\n7. Now, find Rachel's age:\n   **Rachel's age = L + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19**\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_clean": "19", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's correct and complete the solution step-by-step.\n\nLet Leah's age be **L**.
