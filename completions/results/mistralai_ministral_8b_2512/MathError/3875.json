{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=14 minutes to complete the race.", "answer": 10.0, "perturbed_answer": 14.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To solve the problem for the third snail, we first need to determine the speed of each snail and the total distance of the race.\n\n1. The first snail's speed is given as 2 feet per minute.\n2. The second snail's speed is twice that of the first snail, so it is 2 * 2 = 4 feet per minute.\n3. The third snail's speed is five times the rate of the second snail, so it is 5 * 4 = 20 feet per minute.\n\nSince the first snail took 20 minutes to complete the race, we can calculate the total distance of the race using the first snail's speed and time:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time = 2 feet/minute * 20 minutes = 40 feet.\n\nNow, we use the third snail's speed to find the time it took to cover the same distance:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 40 feet / 20 feet/minute = 2 minutes.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how long it took the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.
