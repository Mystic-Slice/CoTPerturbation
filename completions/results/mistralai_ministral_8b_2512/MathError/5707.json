{"id": 5707, "question": "Max has a collection of stamps in three colors: 20 red stamps, 80 blue stamps and 7 yellow ones. He is trying to sell the whole collection. He already sold 20 red stamps for the price of $1.1 for each stamp and 80 blue stamps for the price of $0.8 for each stamp. What price did he need to set for each yellow stamp to be able to earn the total of $100 from the whole sale?", "solution": "Max earned 20 * 1.1 = $<<20*1.1=22>>22 on red stamps.\nFrom the blue stamps Max got 80 * 0.8 = $<<80*0.8=64>>64.\nHis earnings so far are 22 + 64 = $<<22+64=86>>86.\nTo earn $100 he needs 100 \u2013 86 = $<<100-86=14>>14 more.\nMax has 7 yellow stamps, so he needs to set the price at 14 / 7 = $<<14/7=2>>2.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "Max earned 20 * 1.1 = $22 on red stamps.", "perturbed_solution": "Max earned 20 * 1.1 = $47 on red stamps.", "answer": 22.0, "perturbed_answer": 47.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's continue the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate the earnings from blue stamps:\n   Max sold 80 blue stamps at $0.8 each.\n   Earnings from blue stamps = 80 * 0.8 = $64.\n\n2. Calculate the total earnings from red and blue stamps:\n   Total earnings from red and blue stamps = $22 (from red) + $64 (from blue) = $86.\n\n3. Determine the remaining amount needed to reach $100:\n   Remaining amount = $100 - $86 = $14.\n\n4.

Calculate the total earnings from red and blue stamps:\n   Total earnings from red and blue stamps = $47 (from red) + $64 (from blue) = $111.\n\n3. Determine the total amount Max wants to earn from the entire sale:\n   Max wants to earn a total of $100.\n\n   Wait, this seems inconsistent with the previous calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement carefully.\n\n   The problem states Max wants to earn a total of $100 from the whole sale, but he has already earned $47 from red stamps and $64 from blue stamps, totaling $111, which is already more than $100.\n\n   It seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's re-examine the problem statement again.\n\n   The correct interpretation should be that Max wants to earn a total of $100 from selling all his stamps, including the yellow ones. He has already sold some stamps and earned some money, but he needs to set a price for the remaining yellow stamps to reach the total of $100.\n\n   Let's re-calculate:\n\n   Earnings from red stamps = 20 * $1.1 = $22.\n   Earnings from blue stamps = 80 * $0.8 = $64.\n\n   Total earnings from red and blue stamps = $22 + $64 = $86.\n\n   Max wants to earn a total of $100, so the remaining amount he needs to earn from the yellow stamps is:\n   $100 - $86 = $14.\n\n   He has 7 yellow stamps, so the price per yellow stamp should be:\n   $14 / 7 = $2.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
