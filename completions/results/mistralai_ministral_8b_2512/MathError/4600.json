{"id": 4600, "question": "Nick is trying to raise money for a charity. He is selling candy bars for $5. He is also selling chocolate oranges for $10. He wants to raise $1000. He only had 20 chocolate oranges that he sold out. How many candy bars does Nick need to sell to reach his goal?", "solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $<<20*10=200>>200 from the chocolate oranges.\nThis means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800.\nHe needs to sell a total of $800 / $5 = <<800/5=160>>160 candy bars to reach his goal.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $200 from the chocolate oranges.\nThis means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $800.", "perturbed_solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $200 from the chocolate oranges.\nThis means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $348.", "answer": 800.0, "perturbed_answer": 348.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Nick needs to sell enough candy bars to make up the remaining $800.\nSince each candy bar costs $5, the number of candy bars he needs to sell is:\n\n$800 / $5 = 160\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many candy bars Nick needs to sell to reach his goal of $1000, we can use the following steps:\n\n1.
