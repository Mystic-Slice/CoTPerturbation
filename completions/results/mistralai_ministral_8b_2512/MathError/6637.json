Here is the corrected solution:\n\nIf eight liters is 20% of the capacity of one container, then the total capacity of one container is:\n8 liters / 0.20 = 40 liters.\n\nThe total capacity of 40 such containers is:\n40 containers * 40 liters/container = 1600 liters.\n\n#### 1600", "answer_solution_perturbed": "1600"}
