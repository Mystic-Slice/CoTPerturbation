{"id": 3481, "question": "Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has.

Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so before giving these marbles, she had:\n   30 (current marbles) + 60 (given to brother) = 90 marbles.\n\n2. Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother. Since she gave her brother 60 marbles, she gave her sister:\n   2 * 60 = 120 marbles.\n\n   Before giving these marbles to her sister, she had:\n   90 (from step 1) + 120 (given to sister) = 210 marbles.\n\n3. Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. She currently has 30 marbles, so she gave Savanna:\n   3 * 30 = 90 marbles.\n\n4. To find out how many marbles Miriam started with, we add up all the marbles she gave away and her current marbles:\n   60 (brother) + 120 (sister) + 90 (Savanna) + 30 (current) = 300 marbles.\n\n#### 300", "answer_solution_perturbed": "300"}
