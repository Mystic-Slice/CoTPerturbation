Let's correct it:\n\nThe art piece's value in another three years will be three times its value **three years from now**, not its buying price.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- Current value of the art piece (three years after purchase) as \\( V \\).\n- Value in another three years (total of six years from purchase) as \\( 3V \\).\n\nGiven that three years ago, the art piece was purchased for $4000, the value three years from now is the value after six years from purchase. Assuming the price triples over the **next** three years (from now to three years from now), we can set up the following:\n\nLet \\( V \\) be the value of the art piece three years from now.\nThen, \\( 3V \\) is the value in another three years (total of six years from purchase).\n\nSince the price triples over the next three years, we have:\n\\[ V = 3 \\times \\text{current value} \\]\n\nBut the current value is the value three years after purchase, which is not directly given. Instead, we can assume that the price triples over the **next** three years from the current time (three years after purchase).\n\nLet\u2019s denote the current value (three years after purchase) as \\( V \\). Then, in another three years, the value will be \\( 3V \\).\n\nThe question states that the art piece will be three times as much in another three years, meaning:\n\\[ \\text{Value in another three years} = 3 \\times \\text{current value} \\]\n\nThe current value is the value three years after purchase, which is not given directly. However, the problem implies that the value triples over the next three years from the current time (three years after purchase).\n\nTo find the increase, we need to determine the current value of the art piece. Since the art piece was bought for $4000 three years ago, and assuming the value triples over the next three years, we can set up the following:\n\nLet \\( V \\) be the value of the art piece three years from now (current value).\nThen, the value in another three years will be \\( 3V \\).\n\nBut we need to relate this to the initial purchase price. If we assume that the value triples over the next three years from the current time, we can consider the value three years ago as $4000.\n\nIf the value triples every three years, then:\n- Three years ago: $4000\n- Now (three years after purchase): \\( 3 \\times 4000 = $12000 \\)\n- In another three years: \\( 3 \\times 12000 = $36000 \\)\n\nThe increase from the purchase price to the value in another three years is:\n\\[ 36000 - 4000 = 32000 \\]\n\nHowever, the question states that the art piece will be three times as much in another three years, which implies the value in another three years is three times the current value (not the purchase price).\n\nSo, if the current value is \\( V \\), then in another three years, it will be \\( 3V \\).\n\nWe need to find \\( V \\). Since the art piece was bought for $4000 three years ago, and assuming the value triples every three years, the current value \\( V \\) would be:\n\\[ V = 3 \\times 4000 = 12000 \\]\n\nThen, in another three years, the value will be:\n\\[ 3V = 3 \\times 12000 = 36000 \\]\n\nThe increase from the purchase price to the value in another three years is:\n\\[ 36000 - 4000 = 32000 \\]\n\nBut the question asks for the increase by which the art piece will have increased, which is the difference between the value in another three years and the current value:\n\\[ 36000 - 12000 = 24000 \\]\n\nHowever, the question seems to imply the increase from the purchase price to the value in another three years, which is $32000.\n\nBut let's re-examine the question: \"The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years.\" This means the value in another three years is three times the current value.\n\nIf the current value is \\( V \\), then in another three years, it will be \\( 3V \\).\n\nThe question does not specify the current value, but it does say that three years ago, the art piece was purchased for $4000. Assuming the value triples every three years, the current value \\( V \\) would be:\n\\[ V = 3 \\times 4000 = 12000 \\]\n\nSo, in another three years, the value will be:\n\\[ 3V = 3 \\times 12000 = 36000 \\]\n\nThe increase from the purchase price to the value in another three years is:\n\\[ 36000 - 4000 = 32000 \\]\n\nBut the question asks for \"how much money will the art piece have increased by,\" which is the difference between the value in another three years and the current value:\n\\[ 36000 - 12000 = 24000 \\]\n\nGiven the phrasing, it is more likely that the question is asking for the increase from the purchase price to the value in another three years, which is $32000.\n\nHowever, the partial solution incorrectly calculated the increase as $8601, which is incorrect.\n\nThe correct interpretation is that the value in another three years is three times the current value, and the current value is three times the purchase price, leading to the following:\n\nPurchase price three years ago: $4000\nCurrent value (three years after purchase): \\( 3 \\times 4000 = 12000 \\)\nValue in another three years: \\( 3 \\times 12000 = 36000 \\)\n\nThe increase from the purchase price to the value in another three years is:\n\\[ 36000 - 4000 = 32000 \\]\n\nBut if the question is asking for the increase from the current value to the value in another three years, it would be:\n\\[ 36000 - 12000 = 24000 \\]\n\nGiven the phrasing \"how much money will the art piece have increased by,\" it is more natural to interpret it as the increase from the purchase price to the value in another three years.\n\n#### 32000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "32000"}
