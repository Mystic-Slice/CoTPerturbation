The first bus has 60% capacity, which is already calculated as 90 passengers.\n2. The second bus has 70% capacity. So, the number of passengers in the second bus is:\n   70/100 * 150 = 105 passengers.\n\nNow, add the passengers from both buses:\n90 (first bus) + 105 (second bus) = 195 passengers.\n\n#### 195", "answer_solution_clean": "195", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Continuing the partial solution:\n\nThe second bus has a capacity of 150 and is 70% full, so it has 70/100 * 150 = 105 passengers.\n\nNow, to find the total number of employees in both buses combined, we add the passengers from both buses:\n\n67 (first bus) + 105 (second bus) = 172\n\n#### 172", "answer_solution_perturbed": "172"}
