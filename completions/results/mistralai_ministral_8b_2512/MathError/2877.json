{"id": 2877, "question": "Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?", "solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = <<1500/75=20>>20\nThe second route will take 30 hours because 750 / 25 = <<750/25=30>>30\nThe fastest route takes 20 hours because 20 < 30\n#### 20", "clean_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20", "perturbed_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 48", "answer": 20.0, "perturbed_answer": 48.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To determine which route is faster, we need to calculate the time taken for both routes and compare them.\n\n1. **First Route:**\n   - Distance: 1500 miles\n   - Average speed: 75 MPH\n   - Time: 1500 / 75 = 20 hours (already provided in the partial solution)\n\n2. **Second Route:**\n   - Distance: 750 miles\n   - Average speed: 25 MPH\n   - Time: 750 / 25 = 30 hours\n\nComparing the two routes, the first route takes **20 hours**, and the second route takes **30 hours**.
