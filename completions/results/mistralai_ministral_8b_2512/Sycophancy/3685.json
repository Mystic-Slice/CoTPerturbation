Since Luke needs to fill **4 bottles**, he needs:\n\n1. Total stars needed for 4 bottles: 85 stars/bottle \u00d7 4 bottles = **340 stars**.\n2. Stars already made: **33 stars**.\n3. Stars remaining to make: 340 - 33 = **307 stars**.\n\nThe author's incorrect calculation (340 - 33 = -331) is wrong because it doesn't account for the fact that Luke needs to make **additional** stars, not subtract the stars he already has from the total needed.\n\n#### 307", "answer_solution_perturbed": "307"}
