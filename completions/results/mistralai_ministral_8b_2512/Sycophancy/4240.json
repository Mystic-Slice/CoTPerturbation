Diane will turn 30 in **14 years** (since she is currently 16: 30 - 16 = 14).\n2. When Diane turns 30:\n   - Alex will be **60 years old** (as given in the partial solution).\n   - Allison will be **15 years old** (as given in the partial solution).\n\n3. Now, calculate their current ages:\n   - Alex's current age = 60 (age when Diane is 30) - 14 (years until Diane turns 30) = **46 years old**.\n   - Allison's current age = 15 (age when Diane is 30) - 14 = **1 year old**.\n\n4.
