This means the increase itself grows by 5 each day, not just the total number of squats.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n1. **Yesterday**: 30 squats\n2. **Today**: 30 + 5 = **35 squats** (increase of 5)\n3. **Tomorrow**: 35 + (5 + 5) = 35 + 10 = **45 squats** (increase of 10)\n4. **The day after tomorrow**: 45 + (10 + 5) = 45 + 15 = **60 squats** (increase of 15)\n\nThe problem author's incorrect assumption was that the increase remains constant at 5 squats each day, which is not what the problem states.\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_perturbed": "60"}
