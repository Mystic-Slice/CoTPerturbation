To find the unique players, we need to subtract the extra counts of these overlaps.\n\nSo, the number of unique players is:\nUnique players = Total players - Overlaps\n                = 36 - 3\n                = 33\n\nBut this still seems off because if we have 3 overlaps, it means these 3 players were counted twice, so we need to subtract the extra count of these 3 players.\n\nSo, the correct unique count is:\nUnique players = Total players - Overlaps\n                = 36 - 3\n                = 33\n\nBut let's think step-by-step:\n\n- Mona grouped with 9 groups of 4 players each, totaling 36 player instances.\n- Out of these 36 player instances, 3 players were counted twice (once in each of their respective groups).\n\nSo, the number of unique players is:\nUnique players = Total player instances - Overlapping instances\n                = 36 - 3 (since the overlaps were counted twice, we only need to subtract the extra count)\n                = 33\n\nBut actually, the overlaps are already counted twice in the 36, so we need to subtract the overlaps once to correct for the double-counting.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\nUnique players = Total player instances - Overlaps\n                = 36 - 3\n                = 33\n\nHowever, let's verify this with an example:\n\nSuppose Mona grouped with players A, B, C, D in the first group, and A, B, E, F in the second group.

So, the total number of players Mona grouped with is:\n   \\( 9 \\times 4 - 9 = 27 \\) (subtracting Mona herself from the total count).\n   This is because each group has 4 players, but Mona is counted in every group.\n\n2. **Adjusting for repeated players**: Mona grouped with 2 players twice (in one group) and 1 player once (in another group). This means:\n   - The 2 players were counted twice in the total of 27, so we subtract the extra count: \\( 27 - 2 = 25 \\).\n   - The 1 player was counted once, so no further adjustment is needed for this player.\n\n   However, the problem states that the group with 2 players she had grouped with before was counted as overlapping, and the group with 1 player was also overlapping. This means we need to account for the overlaps correctly.\n\n   The correct way to calculate unique players is:\n   - Total unique players = Total players in groups - Mona herself - overlaps.\n   - The overlaps are the players Mona had grouped with before, which were counted twice in the total of 27.\n\n   Since Mona had grouped with 2 players before in one group and 1 player before in another group, we need to subtract the extra counts of these players:\n   - The 2 players were counted twice, so we subtract 1 extra count for each of these 2 players.\n   - The 1 player was counted once, so no extra count to subtract for this player.\n\n   Therefore, the correct calculation is:\n   \\( 27 - 2 = 25 \\) (since the 2 players were counted twice, we subtract the extra count).\n\n   But let's re-evaluate this with a more precise approach:\n\n   - Total players Mona grouped with (excluding herself) is \\( 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\) (since each group has 3 other players).\n   - Mona had grouped with 2 players before in one group and 1 player before in another group, meaning these players were counted twice in the total of 27.\n   - We need to subtract the extra counts of these players: \\( 27 - 2 = 25 \\).\n\n   However, the problem states that the group with 2 players and the group with 1 player were overlapping with previous groups, so we need to consider that these players were already counted in previous groups.\n\n   The correct way to calculate unique players is:\n   - Total unique players = Total players in groups (excluding Mona) - overlaps.\n   - The overlaps are the players Mona had grouped with before, which were counted twice.\n\n   So, the unique players Mona grouped with that weekend are:\n   \\( 27 - 2 = 25 \\).\n\n   But let's verify this with a different approach:\n\n   - Mona had 9 groups, each with 3 other players: \\( 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\).\n   - Out of these 27 players, 2 players were counted twice (in one group) and 1 player was counted once (in another group).\n   - The 2 players were already counted in previous groups, so we subtract the extra count of these 2 players: \\( 27 - 2 = 25 \\).\n\n   Therefore, the number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend is 25.\n\n#### 25", "answer_solution_perturbed": "25"}
