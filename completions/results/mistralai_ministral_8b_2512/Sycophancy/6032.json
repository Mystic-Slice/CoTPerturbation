{"id": 6032, "question": "Nadine went to a garage sale and spent $56. She bought a table for $34 and 2 chairs. Each chair cost the same amount.

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 2x = 22 \\]\n\nTo find the cost of one chair, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{22}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 11 \\]\n\n#### 11", "answer_solution_clean": "11", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's continue the solution using the correct subtraction:\n\nNadine spent $56 in total.
