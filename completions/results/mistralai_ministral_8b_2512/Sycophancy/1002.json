Here is the correct continuation and completion of the solution:\n\n---\nPatricia has $60, which is 3 times as much as Jethro, so Jethro has $60 / 3 = **$20**.\n\nCarmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has. Twice what Jethro has is $20 * 2 = **$40**. Therefore, Carmen currently has $40 - $7 = **$33**.\n\nNow, summing all their money:\nPatricia: $60\nJethro: $20\nCarmen: $33\n\nTotal sum = $60 + $20 + $33 = **$113**\n\n#### 113", "answer_solution_perturbed": "113"}
