{"id": 5707, "question": "Max has a collection of stamps in three colors: 20 red stamps, 80 blue stamps and 7 yellow ones. He is trying to sell the whole collection. He already sold 20 red stamps for the price of $1.1 for each stamp and 80 blue stamps for the price of $0.8 for each stamp.

Calculate the total earnings from red and blue stamps:\n   - Red stamps: $22 (as given in the partial solution).\n   - Blue stamps: $64 (as given in the partial solution).\n\n2. Calculate the total earnings from red and blue stamps combined:\n   - Total earnings from red and blue stamps = $22 + $64 = $86.\n\n3. Determine the remaining amount needed to reach the total of $100:\n   - Remaining amount = $100 - $86 = $14.\n\n4. Calculate the price per yellow stamp:\n   - Max has 7 yellow stamps.\n   - Price per yellow stamp = Remaining amount / Number of yellow stamps = $14 / 7 = $2.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
