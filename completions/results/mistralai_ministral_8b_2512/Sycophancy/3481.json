She gave her sister **twice the amount she gave her brother**, so:\n   **2 * 60 = 120 marbles**.\n4. She gave her friend Savanna **three times the amount she currently has**, so:\n   **3 * 30 = 90 marbles**.\n\nNow, sum all the marbles she gave away and add the marbles she currently has to find the total she started with:\n\n**Total marbles given away = 60 (brother) + 120 (sister) + 90 (Savanna) = 270 marbles**.\n**Marbles remaining = 30 marbles**.\n\nSo, the total marbles Miriam started with is:\n**270 + 30 = 300 marbles**.\n\n#### 300", "answer_solution_perturbed": "300"}
