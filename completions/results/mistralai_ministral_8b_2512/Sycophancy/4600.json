His goal is to raise $1000, so the remaining amount he needs to raise is:\n\n$1000 - $200 = $800.\n\nNick sells each candy bar for $5. To find out how many candy bars he needs to sell to raise the remaining $800, we divide $800 by $5:\n\n$800 / $5 = 160.\n\nSo, Nick needs to sell 160 candy bars to reach his goal.\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's complete the solution correctly based on the given problem.\n\nNick has sold all 20 chocolate oranges at $10 each, so the money raised from chocolate oranges is:\n20 * $10 = $200.\n\nNick wants to raise a total of $1000.
