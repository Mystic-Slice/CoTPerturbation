Next, we calculate how many of these four-leaved clovers are purple:\n   - One quarter of the four-leaved clovers are purple: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25 \\).\n\n#### 25", "answer_solution_clean": "25", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's correct the partial solution and complete the problem step-by-step.\n\n1.
