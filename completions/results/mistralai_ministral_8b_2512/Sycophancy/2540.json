The question states that the art piece will be **three times as much in another three years** from now, not from the purchase date.\n\nLet's correct this:\n\n1. Three years ago, Rosie purchased the art piece for $4000.\n2. Now, the art piece is worth **X**.\n3. In another three years (from now), the art piece will be worth **3 * X**.\n\nSince the price increases from now to the future, we need to find the current value of the art piece first.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- **Current value of the art piece** = **X**\n\nIn three years from now, the art piece will be worth:\n- **3 * X**\n\nAssuming the price increases linearly over time, the price increase from now to three years from now is:\n- **3X - X = 2X**\n\nSince the art piece was bought three years ago for $4000, and assuming it has been appreciating at a constant rate, we can assume the current value **X** is the value after three years of appreciation from the purchase price.\n\nIf the art piece appreciates uniformly, the current value **X** can be found by considering the total increase over the past three years. However, the problem does not specify the rate of appreciation, so we need to assume that the price increase from now to three years from now is the same as the increase from three years ago to now.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the price increases by a factor of **Y** every three years.\n\nSo, three years ago: $4000\nNow: $4000 * Y\nIn three years from now: $4000 * Y^2\n\nAccording to the problem, in three years from now, the art piece will be three times its current value:\n$4000 * Y^2 = 3 * ($4000 * Y)\n\nSimplifying this:\n$4000 * Y^2 = $12000 * Y\nDivide both sides by $4000 * Y (assuming Y \u2260 0):\nY = 3\n\nSo, the art piece doubles in value every three years.\n\nNow, let's find the value in three years from now:\nCurrent value = $4000 * Y = $4000 * 3 = $12000\nIn three years from now = $12000 * Y = $12000 * 3 = $36000\n\nThe increase from the purchase price to the value in three years from now is:\n$36000 - $4000 = $32000\n\nHowever, the question asks for the increase in value by the time it will be three times as much in another three years from now, which is the difference between the value in three years from now and the current value.\n\nSo, the increase from now to three years from now is:\n$36000 - $12000 = $24000\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the initial interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the question carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years.\" This means that in three years from now, the art piece will be worth three times its current value.\n\nSo, if the current value is **X**, then in three years from now, it will be worth **3X**.\n\nThe increase in value from now to three years from now is:\n3X - X = 2X\n\nWe need to find the current value **X**.\n\nSince the art piece was bought three years ago for $4000, and assuming it has appreciated uniformly over the past three years, we can assume that the current value **X** is the value after three years of appreciation.\n\nIf the price increases by a factor of **Y** every three years, then:\nThree years ago: $4000\nNow: $4000 * Y\nIn three years from now: $4000 * Y^2\n\nAccording to the problem, in three years from now, the art piece will be three times its current value:\n$4000 * Y^2 = 3 * ($4000 * Y)\n\nSimplifying:\n$4000 * Y^2 = $12000 * Y\nDivide both sides by $4000 * Y:\nY = 3\n\nSo, the art piece triples in value every three years.\n\nNow, let's find the current value:\nCurrent value = $4000 * Y = $4000 * 3 = $12000\n\nThe value in three years from now will be:\n$12000 * Y = $12000 * 3 = $36000\n\nThe increase in value from the purchase price to the value in three years from now is:\n$36000 - $4000 = $32000\n\nBut the question asks for the increase by the time it will be three times as much in another three years, which is the difference between the value in three years from now and the current value:\n$36000 - $12000 = $24000\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the total increase from the purchase price to the value in three years from now, which is $32000.\n\nBut let's re-examine the question again: \"How much money will the art piece have increased by?\"\n\nGiven the phrasing, it seems to be asking for the total increase from the purchase price to the value in three years from now.\n\nSo, the art piece will have increased by $32000.\n\nBut let's simplify the problem with a different approach:\n\n1. Three years ago, the art piece was bought for $4000.\n2. In another three years (from now), the art piece will be three times its current value.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the current value of the art piece as **C**.\n\nIn three years from now, the art piece will be worth **3C**.\n\nAssuming the art piece appreciates uniformly over time, the increase in value over the next three years is **2C** (since it goes from **C** to **3C**).\n\nWe need to find the current value **C**.\n\nSince the art piece was bought three years ago for $4000, and assuming it has appreciated uniformly over the past three years, let\u2019s denote the appreciation factor over the past three years as **F**.\n\nSo, three years ago: $4000\nNow: $4000 * F = C\n\nIn three years from now: $4000 * F^2 = 3C = 3 * ($4000 * F)\n\nSo, $4000 * F^2 = $12000 * F\nDivide both sides by $4000 * F:\nF = 3\n\nSo, the art piece triples in value every three years.\n\nNow, the current value **C** is:\nC = $4000 * F = $4000 * 3 = $12000\n\nIn three years from now, the art piece will be worth:\n$12000 * 3 = $36000\n\nThe total increase from the purchase price to the value in three years from now is:\n$36000 - $4000 = $32000\n\nTherefore, the art piece will have increased by $32000.\n\n#### 32000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "32000"}
