So, Scott\u2019s funds can be calculated as:\n   Scott\u2019s funds = $3000 / 3 = $1000.\n\n4. Now, let's calculate the total amount collected by Scott, Mary, and Ken:\n   Total collected = Scott\u2019s funds + Mary\u2019s funds + Ken\u2019s funds\n   Total collected = $1000 + $3000 + $600 = $4600.\n\n5.
