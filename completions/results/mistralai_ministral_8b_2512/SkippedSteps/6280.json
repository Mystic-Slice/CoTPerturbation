The number of pepperjack cheese sticks is 45.\n2. The total number of cheese sticks is 90 (as calculated in the partial solution).\n3. The probability of picking a pepperjack cheese stick is the number of pepperjack sticks divided by the total number of sticks: 45 / 90 = 0.5.\n4. Convert the probability to a percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50%.\n\n#### 50", "answer_solution_clean": "50", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 50", "answer_solution_perturbed": "50"}
