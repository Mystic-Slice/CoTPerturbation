{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's continue with the solution:\n\n1. Gary can bake 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour (as given in the partial solution).\n\n2. For the cupcakes:\n   - Gary has 2 pounds of flour left.\n   - Each cupcake requires 1/5 pounds of flour.\n   - Number of cupcakes Gary can bake = 2 / (1/5) = 2 * 5 = 10 cupcakes.\n\n3. Earnings from cakes:\n   - Gary sells each cake for $2.5.\n   - Total earnings from cakes = 8 * $2.5 = $20.\n\n4. Earnings from cupcakes:\n   - Gary sells each cupcake for $1.\n   - Total earnings from cupcakes = 10 * $1 = $10.\n\n5. Total earnings:\n   - Total earnings = $20 (from cakes) + $10 (from cupcakes) = $30.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Gary can bake 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour used for cakes.\n\nFor the cupcakes:\n- Remaining flour = 2 pounds\n- Each cupcake requires 1/5 pounds of flour\n- Number of cupcakes = 2 / (1/5) = 2 * 5 = 10 cupcakes\n\nEarnings:\n- Earnings from cakes = 8 cakes * $2.5 per cake = $20\n- Earnings from cupcakes = 10 cupcakes * $1 per cupcake = $10\n- Total earnings = $20 + $10 = $30\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
