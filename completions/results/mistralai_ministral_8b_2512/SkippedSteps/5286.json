Narcissus flowers:\n   - Total narcissus flowers = 75\n   - Flowers per bouquet = 5\n   - Number of bouquets = 75 / 5 = 15\n\n2. Chrysanthemums:\n   - Total chrysanthemums = 90\n   - Flowers per bouquet = 5\n   - Number of bouquets = 90 / 5 = 18\n\nSince each bouquet must contain 5 flowers and must include both types of flowers, the limiting factor is the type of flower that allows fewer bouquets. Here, the narcissus flowers allow only 15 bouquets.\n\nTherefore, the florist can make a total of 15 bouquets using all the flowers.\n\n#### 15", "answer_solution_clean": "15", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To determine how many bouquets of 5 flowers each the florist can make using all the flowers, we need to consider both types of flowers together.\n\n1.
