Calculate the number of bars needed for the year:\n   - 1 bar lasts for 2 months.\n   - There are 12 months in a year.\n   - Number of bars needed = 12 / 2 = 6 bars.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost:\n   - Cost per bar = $8.00.\n   - Total cost = 6 bars * $8.00 per bar = $48.00.\n\n#### 48", "answer_solution_clean": "48", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
