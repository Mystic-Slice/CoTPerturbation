{"id": 1034, "question": "When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?", "solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 cups of cream cheese.\nShe uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\nFor each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eggs.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese.", "perturbed_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many eggs Betty used, let's continue the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Vanilla Calculation:**\n   Betty uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese.\n   She used 8 cups of cream cheese, so:\n   \\( \\frac{8 \\text{ cups of cream cheese}}{2} = 4 \\text{ teaspoons of vanilla} \\)\n\n2. **Egg Calculation:**\n   For every 1 teaspoon of vanilla, Betty uses 2 eggs.\n   She used 4 teaspoons of vanilla, so:\n   \\( 4 \\text{ teaspoons of vanilla} \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ eggs} \\)\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many eggs Betty used, we need to follow the given ratios step-by-step.\n\n1. **Sugar to Cream Cheese Ratio:**\n   - Betty uses 1 part sugar to 4 parts cream cheese.\n   - She used 2 cups of sugar, so she used \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) cups of cream cheese.\n\n2. **Vanilla to Cream Cheese Ratio:**\n   - She uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese.\n   - With 8 cups of cream cheese, she used \\( \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\) teaspoons of vanilla.\n\n3. **Eggs to Vanilla Ratio:**\n   - She uses 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon of vanilla.\n   - With 4 teaspoons of vanilla, she used \\( 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\) eggs.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
