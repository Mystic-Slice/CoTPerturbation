{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's break down the problem to find the number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend.\n\n1. **Total players in groups**: Mona joined 9 groups, each with 4 players (including herself). So, excluding herself, she played with 9 groups * 4 players = 36 players.\n\n2. **Adjust for overlaps**: Mona is counted in each group, so we need to exclude herself from the total. That leaves us with 36 - 9 = 27 unique players (excluding herself).\n\n3. **Adjust for previous groupings**:\n   - One group had 2 players she had grouped with before. This means 2 players are already counted in the 27 unique players.\n   - Another group had 1 player she had grouped with before. This means 1 more player is already counted in the 27 unique players.\n\n   Since these players are already included in the 27 unique players, no further subtraction is needed for uniqueness.\n\n4. **Unique players calculation**: The 27 unique players already account for the overlaps with previous groupings. Therefore, the number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend is 27.\n\nHowever, let's re-evaluate this carefully:\n\n- Mona is part of each group, so the total number of other players she grouped with is 9 groups * 3 other players per group = 27 players.\n- Out of these 27 players, 2 players were from one group and 1 player was from another group that she had grouped with before. These players are already counted in the 27 unique players.\n\nSo, the number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend is still 27, as these overlaps are already accounted for in the initial count of 27 unique players.\n\nBut let's clarify further:\n\n- Total unique players Mona could have grouped with (excluding herself) is 27.\n- The overlaps (2 players from one group and 1 player from another group) are already part of these 27 unique players.\n\nTherefore, the number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend is:\n\n#### 27", "answer_solution_clean": "27", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution incorrectly counts all players as unique, including those Mona had grouped with before. To find the number of **unique** players Mona grouped with that weekend, we need to account for overlaps:\n\n1. **Total players in groups**: 9 groups \u00d7 4 players = 36 players.\n2. **Overlaps**:\n   - One group had **2 players** Mona had grouped with before (so these 2 are not unique to this weekend).\n   - Another group had **1 player** Mona had grouped with before (so this 1 is not unique to this weekend).\n   - The remaining 7 groups had **no overlaps** (all 28 players are unique to this weekend).\n\n3. **Unique players calculation**:\n   - Unique players from non-overlapping groups: 7 groups \u00d7 4 players = 28.\n   - Unique players from overlapping groups: 1 group (with 2 overlaps) has 4 - 2 = 2 unique players, and 1 group (with 1 overlap) has 4 - 1 = 3 unique players.\n   - Total unique players = 28 + 2 + 3 = **33**.\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
