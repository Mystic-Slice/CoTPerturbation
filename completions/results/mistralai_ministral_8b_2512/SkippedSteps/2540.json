However, the question asks for the increase **over the next three years** (not from the original purchase three years ago).\n\nLet's complete the solution correctly:\n\n1. Three years ago, the art piece was purchased for **$4000**.\n2. In **another three years** (so 6 years from purchase), the art piece will be worth **three times its original purchase price**:\n   **3 * $4000 = $12,000**.\n3. The **current value** (three years after purchase) is unknown, but we can calculate the **increase over the next three years** by comparing the future value to the current value.\n\n   Let **C** be the current value of the art piece (three years after purchase).\n   The future value is **3 * $4000 = $12,000**, so:\n   **$12,000 = 3 * $4,000** (this is the future value, not the current value).\n   Wait, the wording is ambiguous, but the most logical interpretation is that the art piece will be **three times its original price** in **another three years** (i.e., **$12,000**).\n\n   If the art piece was worth **$X** three years ago (purchase price), then in another three years, it will be worth **3 * $X = $12,000**. So **$X = $4,000** (original purchase price).\n\n   Now, the **current value** (three years after purchase) is unknown, but the **increase over the next three years** is the difference between the future value and the current value.\n\n   However, the question likely means that the art piece will be worth **three times its original purchase price** in **another three years**, implying the current value is **$4,000** (since it was purchased three years ago for $4,000, and the price has not changed yet).\n\n   So, the **increase over the next three years** is:\n   **$12,000 (future value) - $4,000 (current value) = $8,000**.\n\n   But this is the same as the partial solution, which suggests the question is asking for the **total increase from purchase to future value**, not the increase over the next three years.\n\n   Alternatively, if the art piece was purchased three years ago for $4,000, and its value will be **three times its current value** in another three years, then:\n\n   Let **C** be the current value (three years after purchase).\n   Then, in another three years, the value will be **3 * C**.\n   The question states that this future value is **three times the original purchase price**, so:\n   **3 * C = 3 * $4,000 = $12,000**.\n   So **C = $4,000**.\n\n   This implies the art piece's value has **not changed in the last three years**, and will increase by **$12,000 - $4,000 = $8,000** in the next three years.\n\n   But this seems inconsistent with the wording.\n\n   The most plausible interpretation is that the art piece will be worth **three times its original purchase price** in **another three years**, meaning:\n   - Original purchase price: **$4,000** (three years ago).\n   - Current value (three years after purchase): **unknown**, but the future value (in another three years) is **$12,000**.\n   - The **increase over the next three years** is **$12,000 - current value**.\n\n   But without knowing the current value, we cannot determine the increase over the next three years.\n\n   The partial solution assumes the current value is still $4,000, which is likely incorrect.\n\n   The correct interpretation is that the art piece will be worth **three times its original purchase price** in **another three years**, meaning:\n   - Original purchase price: **$4,000** (three years ago).\n   - Current value (three years after purchase): **unknown**.\n   - Future value (in another three years): **3 * $4,000 = $12,000**.\n   - The **increase over the next three years** is **$12,000 - current value**.\n\n   But the question does not provide the current value, so the only logical answer is that the **total increase from purchase to future value** is **$8,000**.\n\n   However, the question asks for the **increase by** (which likely means the **increase over the next three years**).\n\n   Given the ambiguity, the most reasonable answer is that the art piece will increase by **$8,000** over the next three years (assuming the current value is $4,000).\n\n#### 8000", "answer_solution_clean": "8000", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 8000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8000"}
