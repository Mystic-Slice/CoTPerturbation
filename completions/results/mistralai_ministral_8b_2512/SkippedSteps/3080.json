{"id": 3080, "question": "Tony has two fish. Every year, his parents buy him two more, but one of them dies. How many fish will he have in five years?", "solution": "Each year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 - 1 = <<2-1=1>>1\nIn five years, he will have 5 more fish because 5 x 1 = <<5*1=5>>5\nIn five years he will have 7 fish because 2 + 5 = <<2+5=7>>7\n#### 7", "clean_solution": "Each year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 - 1 = 1", "perturbed_solution": "Each year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 - 1 = 1\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find the total number of fish Tony will have in five years.\n\n1. **Initial number of fish**: Tony starts with 2 fish.\n\n2. **Annual change**: Each year, Tony gains 2 fish (from his parents) and loses 1 fish (due to death), resulting in a net gain of 1 fish per year.\n\n3. **Fish count over five years**:\n   - Year 0: 2 fish\n   - Year 1: 2 + 1 = 3 fish\n   - Year 2: 3 + 1 = 4 fish\n   - Year 3: 4 + 1 = 5 fish\n   - Year 4: 5 + 1 = 6 fish\n   - Year 5: 6 + 1 = 7 fish\n\nAlternatively, you can calculate it as:\n   - Initial fish: 2\n   - Net gain per year: 1\n   - Total net gain over 5 years: 5 * 1 = 5\n   - Total fish after 5 years: 2 + 5 = 7\n\n#### 7", "answer_solution_clean": "7", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 7", "answer_solution_perturbed": "7"}
