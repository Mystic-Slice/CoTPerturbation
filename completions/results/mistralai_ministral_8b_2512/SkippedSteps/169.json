{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "mistralai/ministral-8b-2512", "completed_solution_clean": "To find out how many kilograms of grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing his production by twenty percent, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current annual usage:\n   Borris uses 90 kilograms every 6 months, so in a year (12 months), he uses:\n   90 x 2 = 180 kilograms per year.\n\n2. Calculate the twenty percent increase:\n   Twenty percent of 180 kilograms is:\n   0.20 x 180 = 36 kilograms.\n\n3. Add the increase to the current annual usage:\n   180 kilograms + 36 kilograms = 216 kilograms.\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the new amount of grapes Borris will need after increasing his production by twenty percent.\n\n1.
