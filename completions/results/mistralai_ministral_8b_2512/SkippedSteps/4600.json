His goal is to raise $1000, so the remaining amount he needs to raise is:\n\n$1000 - $200 = $800.\n\nNick sells each candy bar for $5. To find out how many candy bars he needs to sell to raise the remaining $800, we divide the remaining amount by the price of each candy bar:\n\n$800 / $5 = 160.\n\nSo, Nick needs to sell 160 candy bars to reach his goal.\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Nick needs to raise an additional $800 from selling candy bars (since $1000 - $200 = $800).\n\nThe number of candy bars he needs to sell is $800 / $5 = 160.\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_perturbed": "160"}
