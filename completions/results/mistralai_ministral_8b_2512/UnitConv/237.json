He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.\n\nThen, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters. So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 540\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `3 * 60 = 180 meters` to modify.

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is speed * time, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.\n\nNext, he spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is again speed * time, so he drives 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\nFinally, he spends the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is speed * time, so he drives 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nSo, in total, during the 4 hours of his return trip, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles towards home.\n\nHowever, he was initially 180 miles away from home. So, at the end of those 4 hours, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours` to modify.

From the partial solution, we know:\n   - Emma gathered **60 eggs** in the second round.\n   - Since Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in the second round, Tank gathered **30 eggs** in the second round.\n\n2. The problem also states:\n   - Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was **20 less** than the number she gathered in the first round.\n   - Let \\( T_1 \\) be the number of eggs Tank gathered in the first round.\n   - Then, \\( T_2 = T_1 - 20 \\).\n   - We know \\( T_2 = 30 \\), so:\n     \\[\n     30 = T_1 - 20 \\implies T_1 = 50\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, Tank gathered **50 eggs** in the first round.\n\n3. The problem states:\n   - In the first round, Tank gathered **10 more eggs** than Emma.\n   - Let \\( E_1 \\) be the number of eggs Emma gathered in the first round.\n   - Then, \\( T_1 = E_1 + 10 \\).\n   - We know \\( T_1 = 50 \\), so:\n     \\[\n     50 = E_1 + 10 \\implies E_1 = 40\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, Emma gathered **40 eggs** in the first round.\n\n4.
