Each trip is 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 miles.\nLaura drives 40 miles twice a week to visit the supermarket. Therefore she drives 40 x 2 =<<40*2=80>>80 miles in total a week to and from the supermarket.\nIn total Laura drives 140 + 80 = <<140+80=220>>220 miles each week.\n#### 220", "clean_solution": "7 days a week Laura drives 20 miles to school, so Laura drives 7 x 20 = 140 miles to school in one week.\n", "perturbed_solution": "7 days a week Laura drives 20 miles to school, so Laura drives 7 x 20 miles = 225.3076 kilometers to school in one week.", "answer": 220.0, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "UnitConvFinal", "final_prompt": "\n\n<conversionFactors>\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n1 meter = 100 centimeters\n1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers\n1 mph = 1.60934 kmph\n$1 = 100 cents\n</conversionFactors>\n\n<instructions>\nGiven an input question and answer pair, follow these instructions carefully:\n1. Pick an equation that appears in the middle of the calculation in the answer that has a unit of measurement from the ones given in the conversion factors. ONLY pick equations that have a unit of measurement from the ABOVE GIVEN CONVERSION FACTORS. The units might not be explicitly mentioned in the solution, so you need to infer them based on the context of the problem.\n2. Under the `modified` section, modify the equation by changing the unit of measurement to a different unit of measurement that is related to the original unit of measurement. Only use the given conversion factors to make the change.\n3. You should not change the correctness of the equation. The value must be equivalent to the original but in a different unit of measurement.\n4. Your response should contain only the output. Do not repeat the input. \n5. Your response should contain only incomplete answers until the chosen / modified equation. Any text after that equation should be removed. Cut off equations at the point where the unit conversion is made, even if the equation remains incomplete.\n6.

He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.\n\nThen, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters. So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 540\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `3 * 60 = 180 meters` to modify. I will change the unit from meters to centimeters. I will change the number 180 to 18000 because from the given conversionFactors, it is known that 1 meter = 100 centimeter. And I will cut off the answer at that point.\n</explanation>\n\n<original>\n\n        A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day.

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is speed * time, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.\n\nNext, he spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is again speed * time, so he drives 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\nFinally, he spends the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is speed * time, so he drives 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nSo, in total, during the 4 hours of his return trip, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles towards home.\n\nHowever, he was initially 180 miles away from home. So, at the end of those 4 hours, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours` to modify. I will change the number 1.5 to 90 because from the given conversionFactors, it is known that 1 hour = 60 minutes. I will replace the unit hours with minutes.

Laura drives to the supermarket two afternoons a week:\n   - The supermarket is 10 miles farther from the school than Laura\u2019s house.\n     This means the round trip to the supermarket is 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60 miles (since Laura drives from her house to the supermarket and back).\n     Alternatively, since the supermarket is 10 miles farther from the school than her house, the one-way distance from the school to the supermarket is 20 + 10 = 30 miles.\n     Therefore, the round trip to the supermarket is 30 x 2 = 60 miles.\n\n   - For 2 afternoons: 2 x 60 = 120 miles.\n\n3.
