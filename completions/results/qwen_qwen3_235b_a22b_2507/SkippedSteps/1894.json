{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "So far, the total time spent walking dogs is:\n\n- Monday poodles: 8 hours  \n- Monday Chihuahuas: 2 hours  \n- Tuesday Chihuahuas: 2 hours  \n- Wednesday Labradors: 12 hours  \n\nTotal so far: 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours\n\nCharlotte has a total of 32 hours available this week, so the remaining time for Tuesday poodles is:\n\n32 - 24 = 8 hours\n\nSince it takes 2 hours to walk one poodle, the number of poodles she can walk on Tuesday is:\n\n8 \u00f7 2 = 4\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "So far, the total time spent is:\n\n- Monday: 8 hours (poodles) + 2 hours (Chihuahuas) = 10 hours  \n- Tuesday: 2 hours (Chihuahuas)  \n- Wednesday: 12 hours (Labradors)  \n\nTotal so far: 10 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours\n\nCharlotte has 32 hours available, so the remaining time is:\n\n32 - 24 = 8 hours\n\nThis remaining time is for walking poodles on Tuesday.
