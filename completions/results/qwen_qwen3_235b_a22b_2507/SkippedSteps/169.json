{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.  \nIncreasing his production by 20% means he needs an additional 20% of 180 kilograms.  \n20% of 180 = 0.20 \u00d7 180 = 36 kilograms.  \nSo, the total amount of grapes needed = 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.  \n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.  \nHe wants to increase production by 20%, so the increase is 20% of 180 = 0.20 \u00d7 180 = 36 kilograms.  \nTherefore, the total grapes needed per year after the increase is 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.  \n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
