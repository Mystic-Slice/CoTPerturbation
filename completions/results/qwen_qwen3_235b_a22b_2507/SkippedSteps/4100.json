However, the number of intervals between the four checkpoints is 3. But note: the first checkpoint is 1 mile from the start, and the last is 1 mile from the finish, and they are placed along the 24-mile stretch between these points.\n\nWait \u2014 actually, re-evaluating: there are four checkpoints total. The first is 1 mile from the start, and the last (fourth) is 1 mile from the finish. So the four checkpoints are placed along the 24-mile segment between the 1-mile mark and the 25-mile mark (since the total is 26 miles, and the finish is at 26, same as start due to circular).\n\nBut the distance between the first and last checkpoint is 24 miles, and there are three equal intervals between the four checkpoints.\n\nSo, the distance between each consecutive pair of checkpoints is:\n\n24 miles \u00f7 3 = 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
