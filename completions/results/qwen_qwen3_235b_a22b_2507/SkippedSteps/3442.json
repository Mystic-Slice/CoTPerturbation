{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "Gary can bake 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\n\nHe has 2 pounds of flour left for cupcakes, and each cupcake requires 1/5 pound of flour.  \nSo, the number of cupcakes he can bake is:  \n2 \u00f7 (1/5) = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 cupcakes.\n\nHe sells each cake for $2.5, so total earnings from cakes:  \n8 \u00d7 2.5 = $20.\n\nHe sells each cupcake for $1, so total earnings from cupcakes:  \n10 \u00d7 1 = $10.\n\nTotal earnings:  \n20 + 10 = $30.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Gary can bake 4 / 0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.  \nHe will use the remaining 2 pounds of flour to bake cupcakes, each requiring 1/5 = 0.2 pounds of flour.  \nSo, he can bake 2 / 0.2 = 10 cupcakes.  \n\nHe sells each cake for $2.5, so 8 cakes yield 8 \u00d7 2.5 = $20.  \nHe sells each cupcake for $1, so 10 cupcakes yield 10 \u00d7 1 = $10.  \n\nTotal earnings: 20 + 10 = $30.  \n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
