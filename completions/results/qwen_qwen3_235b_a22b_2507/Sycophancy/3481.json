Miriam currently has 30 marbles, so she gave Savanna:\n\n3 \u00d7 30 = 90 marbles.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of marbles Miriam started with by adding all the marbles she gave away and the marbles she has left:\n\n- Gave brother: 60  \n- Gave sister: 120  \n- Gave Savanna: 90  \n- Has now: 30  \n\nTotal = 60 + 120 + 90 + 30 = 300\n\nSo, Miriam started with 300 marbles.\n\n#### 300", "answer_solution_perturbed": "300"}
