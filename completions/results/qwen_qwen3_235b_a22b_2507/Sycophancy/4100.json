{"id": 4100, "question": "A 26-mile circular marathon has four checkpoints inside it. The first is one mile from the start line, and the last checkpoint is one mile from the finish line.

However, the spacing is between consecutive checkpoints. If there are 4 checkpoints, there are 3 intervals between them.\n\nBut the problem says the first is 1 mile from the start, and the last is 1 mile from the finish, and they are equally spaced. So the 4 checkpoints are placed along the 24-mile stretch, and we are to divide that 24 miles into 3 equal segments (since 4 checkpoints create 3 intervals between them).\n\nWait \u2014 actually, re-evaluating: if the first checkpoint is at 1 mile, and the last checkpoint is at 25 miles (1 mile before the finish), and there are four checkpoints total, equally spaced along the 24-mile span from 1 to 25, then we are dividing the 24 miles into 3 equal intervals.\n\nSo the distance between each consecutive checkpoint is:\n\n24 \u00f7 (4 - 1) = 24 \u00f7 3 = 8 miles.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the partial solution says: \"There are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, so the checkpoints are 24 / 4 = 6 miles apart.\" That would be correct only if the 24 miles were divided into 4 equal segments.\n\nBut if there are 4 checkpoints equally spaced over a 24-mile stretch, the number of intervals between them is 3, not 4 \u2014 unless the 24 miles includes 4 segments.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify:\n\n- Start: 0 miles\n- Checkpoint 1: 1 mile\n- Checkpoint 2: ?\n- Checkpoint 3: ?\n- Checkpoint 4: 25 miles (since it's 1 mile before finish)\n- Finish: 26 miles\n\nSo the four checkpoints are at positions: 1, x, y, 25.\n\nWe are told they are equally spaced.\n\nSo the distance between checkpoint 1 and checkpoint 4 spans 3 intervals: from 1 to 25 is 24 miles.\n\nSo each interval is 24 \u00f7 3 = 8 miles.\n\nThus:\n- CP1: 1\n- CP2: 1 + 8 = 9\n- CP3: 17\n- CP4: 25\n\nSo the spacing is 8 miles.\n\nBut the partial solution says 24 / 4 = 6, which is wrong.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"The checkpoints have equal spacing between them.\" and there are four checkpoints.\n\nSo number of intervals between four checkpoints is 3.\n\nThus, spacing = 24 / 3 = 8 miles.\n\nBut wait \u2014 perhaps the author meant that the 24 miles are divided into 4 equal parts? That would only make sense if there were 5 checkpoints.\n\nBut there are only 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first and last are included, and we are to place 4 checkpoints over the 24-mile span with equal spacing between them \u2014 that is, 3 intervals.\n\nSo 24 miles / 3 intervals = 8 miles per interval.\n\nTherefore, the correct spacing is 8 miles.\n\nBut the partial solution says 24 / 4 = 6, and then says \"the problem author thinks 24/4 = 4\", which is incorrect arithmetic.\n\nBut we are to continue and complete the solution correctly.\n\nSo correcting:\n\nThe distance between the first and last checkpoint is 25 - 1 = 24 miles.\n\nThere are 4 checkpoints, so number of intervals between them is 3.\n\nThus, spacing = 24 / 3 = 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
