{"id": 6394, "question": "Of the 100 soccer balls that Nova went to inflate, 40 percent had holes in them and could not inflate, while 20% of the remaining balls were overinflated and exploded.

The statement \"The problem author thinks 100 - 40 = -56\" is incorrect. The correct calculation is:\n\n100 - 40 = 60\n\nSo, 60 soccer balls remained that could potentially be inflated.\n\nNext, 20% of these 60 balls were overinflated and exploded:\n\n20% of 60 = (20/100) \u00d7 60 = 0.2 \u00d7 60 = 12 balls\n\nSo, 12 balls exploded.\n\nTherefore, the number of balls that were inflated successfully and could be used is:\n\n60 - 12 = 48\n\n#### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
