{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= 8 dollars that Billy should contribute.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= 1 dollars that Billy should contribute.", "answer": 8.0, "perturbed_answer": 1.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "There is an error in the last step of the partial solution. The calculation 10 * 0.8 is incorrect as written \u2014 it should be 10 * 0.8 = 8, not 1.\n\nLet's correct and complete the solution:\n\n- Each meal costs $20 (steak) + $5 (drink) = $25.\n- Two meals: $25 \u00d7 2 = $50.\n- A 20% tip on $50 is: $50 \u00d7 0.20 = $10.\n- Billy wants to cover 80% of the $10 tip: $10 \u00d7 0.80 = $8.\n\nSo, Billy should pay $8 in tips.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
