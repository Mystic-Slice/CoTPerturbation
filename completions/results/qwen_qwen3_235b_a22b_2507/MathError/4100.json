{"id": 4100, "question": "A 26-mile circular marathon has four checkpoints inside it. The first is one mile from the start line, and the last checkpoint is one mile from the finish line. The checkpoints have equal spacing between them.

However, the spacing is between consecutive checkpoints, so we need to determine how many intervals there are between these 4 checkpoints.\n\nWith 4 checkpoints placed along the 24-mile stretch, there are 3 equal intervals between them.\n\nThus, the distance between each consecutive checkpoint is 24 \u00f7 3 = 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
