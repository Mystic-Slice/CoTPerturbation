{"id": 4789, "question": "Since it is Maurice's turn to host this year\u2019s neighborhood cookout, he goes to the local wholesale club to buy ground beef. The wholesale club sells ground beef in 5-pound packages. Maurice wants to make one 2-pound burger for each person that attends, so he purchases 4 packages of ground beef. How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?", "solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = <<10-1=9>>9 people\n#### 9", "clean_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = 9 people", "perturbed_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = 1 people", "answer": 9.0, "perturbed_answer": 1.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 9", "answer_solution_clean": "9", "completed_solution_perturbed": "There is an error in the final step of the partial solution. Let's correct and complete it.\n\nMaurice buys 4 packages of ground beef, each weighing 5 pounds:  \n4 \u00d7 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\n\nEach burger uses 2 pounds, so the number of burgers he can make is:  \n20 \u00f7 2 = 10 burgers.\n\nThese 10 burgers are for all attendees, including Maurice.
