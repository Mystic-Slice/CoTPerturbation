{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=14 minutes to complete the race.", "answer": 10.0, "perturbed_answer": 14.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "The third snail travels at five times the rate of speed of the second snail. Since the second snail takes 10 minutes to complete the race, and speed and time are inversely proportional, the third snail will take 1/5 of the time it took the second snail.\n\nSo, the time taken by the third snail is:\n\n10 / 5 = 2 minutes.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "There is an error in the partial solution. Let's correct and complete it.\n\nThe first snail traveled at 2 feet per minute and took 20 minutes to complete the sidewalk.  \nSo, the total distance of the sidewalk is:  \nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 2 feet/min \u00d7 20 min = 40 feet.\n\nThe second snail traveled at twice the speed of the first:  \nSpeed of second snail = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 feet per minute.\n\nThe third snail traveled at five times the speed of the second snail:  \nSpeed of third snail = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 feet per minute.\n\nNow, to find how long it took the third snail to travel the same 40 feet:  \nTime = Distance / Speed = 40 feet / 20 feet per minute = 2 minutes.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
