{"id": 957, "question": "A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?", "solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240", "clean_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.", "perturbed_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 639 coals.", "answer": 180.0, "perturbed_answer": 639.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "Since the grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes, we can determine how many 20-minute intervals are needed to burn 180 coals.\n\nEach interval burns 15 coals, so the number of intervals is:\n\n180 \u00f7 15 = 12 intervals.\n\nEach interval is 20 minutes, so the total time is:\n\n12 \u00d7 20 = 240 minutes.\n\n#### 240", "answer_solution_clean": "240", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution contains an error.
