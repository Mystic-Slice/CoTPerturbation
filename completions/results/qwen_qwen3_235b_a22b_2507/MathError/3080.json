{"id": 3080, "question": "Tony has two fish. Every year, his parents buy him two more, but one of them dies. How many fish will he have in five years?", "solution": "Each year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 - 1 = <<2-1=1>>1\nIn five years, he will have 5 more fish because 5 x 1 = <<5*1=5>>5\nIn five years he will have 7 fish because 2 + 5 = <<2+5=7>>7\n#### 7", "clean_solution": "Each year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 - 1 = 1\nIn five years, he will have 5 more fish because 5 x 1 = 5\nIn five years he will have 7 fish because 2 + 5 = 7", "perturbed_solution": "Each year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 - 1 = 1\nIn five years, he will have 5 more fish because 5 x 1 = 5\nIn five years he will have 7 fish because 2 + 5 = 9", "answer": 7.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 7", "answer_solution_clean": "7", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Each year, Tony gains 2 fish and loses 1, so the net increase is 2 - 1 = 1 fish per year.\n\nStarting with 2 fish, after 5 years, he gains 5 \u00d7 1 = 5 fish.\n\nSo, total fish after 5 years = 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nThe error in the partial solution is in the last line: it says 2 + 5 = 9, which is incorrect.
