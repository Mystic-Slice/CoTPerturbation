{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 15 people.", "answer": 36.0, "perturbed_answer": 15.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "Mona played with 36 people in total across the groups, but this count includes repeated players. \n\nOne group had 2 players she had grouped with before, and another group had 1 such player. These are the only repetitions mentioned, and since the question asks how many **unique** players she grouped with **that weekend**, we only care about how many **new** unique players she played with during the weekend.\n\nHowever, the repetitions (2 players in one group and 1 in another) were **from before the weekend**, not within the weekend itself. That means those three instances are not duplicates **within** the weekend \u2014 they are just players she had grouped with in prior weekends. So if she grouped with them again this weekend, they still count as unique players **this weekend**, unless she played with them more than once **during** this weekend.\n\nThe problem does **not** say she grouped with the same player multiple times **this weekend** \u2014 it only says that in one group, two players were familiar from **before**, and in another group, one was familiar. There's no indication of overlap **within** the weekend's groups.\n\nTherefore, all 9 groups consist of players she played with during the weekend, and unless there's overlap **within** the weekend, we assume all are unique unless stated otherwise.\n\nBut the problem only tells us about prior connections, not repeated groupings within the weekend. Since no information is given about her grouping with the same player **twice during the weekend**, we assume all 36 player appearances are from distinct groupings, and with no repeated players **within the weekend**, the number of unique players is simply:\n\n9 groups \u00d7 4 players = 36 player slots, all filled by different people (since no duplicates within the weekend are mentioned).\n\nEven if she had grouped with someone before the weekend, if it's the first time that weekend, they still count toward the unique players **that weekend** \u2014 unless she played with them more than once **that weekend**.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\n- One group had 2 players she had grouped with **before** (i.e., not during this weekend) \u2014 so those two are not new, but she played with them once this weekend.\n- Another group had 1 such player.\n\nBut again, unless she played with any player **twice during the weekend**, all 36 are unique.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the key is: are any of the 36 the same person?\n\nThe problem doesn't say she played with the same person twice **this weekend**. It only says that 2 players were known from before, and 1 other was known. That doesn't imply repetition within the weekend.\n\nTherefore, we assume no repeated players **within** the weekend.\n\nHence, total unique players she grouped with **that weekend** is 9 \u00d7 4 = 36.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nSuppose the 2 players she had grouped with before \u2014 she played with them again this weekend, in one group. That\u2019s fine \u2014 they are still part of this weekend\u2019s count.\n\nSimilarly, the one in another group.\n\nBut unless she played with the same player in two different groups **this weekend**, all 36 are unique.\n\nNo such overlap is mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the number of unique players she grouped with **during the weekend** is 36.\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_clean": "36", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Mona joined 9 groups, and each group consists of 4 other players, so initially, she played with:\n\n9 \u00d7 4 = 36 player instances.\n\nHowever, some of these were repeats. According to the problem:\n\n- One group included two players she had grouped with before (that weekend), meaning these are duplicates from earlier groups.\n- Another group included one such repeat player.\n\nSo, there are 2 + 1 = 3 instances where she grouped with someone she had already grouped with earlier that weekend.\n\nThese are not unique players \u2014 they are repeats. So, out of the 36 player instances, 3 are duplicates (i.e., 3 extra counts of players already counted).\n\nTherefore, the number of unique players is:\n\n36 \u2212 3 = 33.\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
