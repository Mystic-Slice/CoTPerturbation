{"id": 6941, "question": "Last Sunday, Logan went to church and realized that the number of children present was 80. If there were 60 male adults, and the total number of people in the church was 200, how many female adults were present?", "solution": "The total number of male adults and children is 80+60 = <<80+60=140>>140 people.\nThe number of females is 200-140 = <<200-140=60>>60 female adults.\n#### 60", "clean_solution": "The total number of male adults and children is 80+60 = 140 people.", "perturbed_solution": "The total number of male adults and children is 80+60 = 233 people.", "answer": 140.0, "perturbed_answer": 233.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "The total number of people in the church is 200.  \nThe number of male adults and children is 140.  \nTherefore, the number of female adults is 200 - 140 = 60.  \n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_clean": "60", "completed_solution_perturbed": "There seems to be an error in the partial solution. The total number of people in the church is given as 200, but the partial solution says the number of children (80) plus male adults (60) is 80 + 60 = 140, not 233.\n\nSo, the total number of children and male adults is:\n\n80 (children) + 60 (male adults) = 140 people.\n\nThe total number of people in the church is 200.
