{"id": 7119, "question": "Jerry was asked by her mom to do grocery shopping. He needs to buy 2 liters of mustard oil that costs $13 per liter, 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta that costs $4 per pound, and 1  pound of pasta sauce that costs $5. If Jerry can keep the rest of the $50 after grocery shopping, how much money will he have?", "solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $<<13*2=26>>26.\nThe cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nSo, Jerry spent a total of $26 + $12 + $5 = $<<26+12+5=43>>43 for grocery shopping.\nThus, Jerry will have $50 - $43 = $<<50-43=7>>7 for himself.\n#### 7", "clean_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $26.", "perturbed_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $98.", "answer": 26.0, "perturbed_answer": 98.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507", "completed_solution_clean": "The cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $12.  \nThe cost of 1 pound of pasta sauce is $5.  \nThe total cost of the groceries is $26 + $12 + $5 = $43.  \nJerry has $50, so the amount of money he will have left is $50 - $43 = $7.  \n#### 7", "answer_solution_clean": "7", "completed_solution_perturbed": "There is an error in the partial solution.
