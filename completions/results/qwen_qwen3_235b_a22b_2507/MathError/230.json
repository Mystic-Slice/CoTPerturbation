If Emery reads five times as fast as Serena, then Serena reads five times slower. So if Emery took 20 days to read the book, then Serena would take 5 times longer, not shorter.\n\nLet's correct that:\n\nEmery takes 20 days to read the book.  \nSince Emery reads 5 times as fast as Serena, Serena takes 5 \u00d7 20 = 100 days to read the book.\n\nNow, to find the average number of days they take to read the book:\n\nAverage = (Emery's time + Serena's time) / 2  \nAverage = (20 + 100) / 2 = 120 / 2 = 60\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_perturbed": "60"}
