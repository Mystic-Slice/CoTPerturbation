He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.\n\nThen, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters. So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 540\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `3 * 60 = 180 meters` to modify.

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is speed * time, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.\n\nNext, he spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is again speed * time, so he drives 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\nFinally, he spends the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is speed * time, so he drives 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nSo, in total, during the 4 hours of his return trip, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles towards home.\n\nHowever, he was initially 180 miles away from home.

He takes a rest stop every 2 hours of driving. Since he drives for 12 hours:\n\nNumber of 2-hour intervals = 12 / 2 = 6\n\nBut he does not rest after the final segment (upon arrival), so he only rests **after each of the first 5 intervals**. So he makes **5 rest stops**, each lasting 15 minutes.\n\nTotal rest stop time = 5 \u00d7 15 = 75 minutes.\n\nNow, consider gas refills. His car gets 18 miles per gallon, and he starts with a full tank. The tank must have more than 15 gallons since the indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons. He refills when he's used 15 gallons.\n\nGas used per 15 gallons: 15 gallons \u00d7 18 miles/gallon = 270 miles.\n\nSo he needs to refill after every 270 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 600 miles.\n\n- After 270 miles: first refill\n- After 540 miles: second refill\n- At 600 miles, he arrives, so no refill needed after that.\n\nSo he refills **2 times**, each taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal refill time = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20 minutes.\n\nNow, total time = driving time + rest stop time + refill time  \n= 720 + 75 + 20 = 815 minutes.\n\n#### 815", "answer_solution_clean": "815", "completed_solution_perturbed": "First, let's correct the partial solution. It says:\n\n\"600 miles / 50 miles per hour = 12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 43200 seconds.\"\n\nThis is incorrect in context and units. Let's fix it step by step.\n\nDriving time:\n600 miles \u00f7 50 mph = 12 hours of driving time.\n12 hours = 12 \u00d7 60 = 720 minutes.\n\nNow, consider rest stops:\nJeremy takes a rest stop every 2 hours of driving.\nIn 12 hours of driving, he drives for 2 hours, then stops, and so on.\n\nNumber of 2-hour intervals in 12 hours: 12 \u00f7 2 = 6 intervals.\nBut he only takes a rest stop **after** each 2-hour segment of driving \u2014 so after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours.\n\nHowever, he does **not** take a rest stop after arriving \u2014 so no rest stop at the very end.\n\nSo he takes a rest stop after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours \u2014 that\u2019s 5 rest stops.\n\nEach rest stop is 15 minutes, so rest time = 5 \u00d7 15 = 75 minutes.\n\nNow, consider gas refills:\nHis car gets 18 miles per gallon.\nHe starts with a full tank, but we need to know when he needs to refill.\n\nGas indicator comes on after he has used 15 gallons.\nSo, distance on 15 gallons: 15 gallons \u00d7 18 mpg = 270 miles.\n\nSo every 270 miles, he stops to refill.\n\nTotal trip: 600 miles.\n\nHe will use 600 \u00f7 18 = 33.33... gallons total, so he will need to refill.\n\nHe starts with a full tank \u2014 assume it's more than 15 gallons (since indicator comes on at 15 used), so first refill happens after 270 miles.\n\nLet\u2019s find how many times he uses 15 gallons:\n\n- After 270 miles: first refill (15 gallons used)\n- After another 270 miles (540 miles): second refill (30 gallons used)\n- Then he has 60 more miles to go (600 - 540), which uses 60 \u00f7 18 \u2248 3.33 gallons \u2014 so he doesn\u2019t reach 15 gallons again.\n\nSo he needs to refill **twice** \u2014 at 270 miles and 540 miles.\n\nBut does he stop both times?\n\nYes \u2014 the problem says \"his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons, at which point he stops to refill\".\n\nSo he stops after using each 15 gallons \u2014 i.e., at 270 and 540 miles.\n\nEach refill takes 10 minutes, so 2 \u00d7 10 = 20 minutes for refueling.\n\nNow, we must check if any refill stop coincides with a rest stop \u2014 could there be overlap?\n\nRest stops occur every 2 hours of driving.\n\nDriving at 50 mph, in 2 hours he covers 100 miles.\n\nSo rest stops at: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and (would be 600, but he arrives, so no rest stop).\n\nWait \u2014 earlier we said rest stops after every 2 hours of driving \u2014 so time-based, not distance-based.\n\nBut since speed is constant, distance intervals are regular.\n\nHe drives 50 mph \u2192 in 2 hours: 100 miles.\n\nSo rest stops at: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 miles.\n\nRefill stops at: 270 and 540 miles.\n\nAre any of these at the same time?\n\n- 270 vs 100, 200, 300 \u2014 not matching \u2192 no overlap\n- 540 vs 500 and 600 \u2014 540 is not a rest stop point\n\nSo refill at 270 and 540 \u2014 not aligned with rest stops.\n\nSo both refill stops are **in addition** to rest stops.\n\nBut wait \u2014 does he take a rest stop at 500 miles? Yes \u2014 that\u2019s after 10 hours of driving.\n\nThen he drives 100 more miles (from 500 to 600), which takes 2 hours \u2014 so no rest stop at 600.\n\nRefill at 540 miles \u2014 that\u2019s 540 \u00f7 50 = 10.8 hours into driving time.\n\nRest stops are at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 hours \u2014 so at 10.8 hours, no rest stop.\n\nSo refill at 540 miles occurs at 10.8 hours driving time \u2014 not coinciding with rest stop.\n\nSimilarly, 270 miles \u00f7 50 mph = 5.4 hours \u2014 rest stops at 4 and 6 hours \u2014 so not aligned.\n\nTherefore, all stops are separate.\n\nSo total time:\n\n- Driving: 720 minutes\n- Rest stops: 5 stops \u00d7 15 minutes = 75 minutes\n- Refill stops: 2 stops \u00d7 10 minutes = 20 minutes\n\nTotal time = 720 + 75 + 20 = 815 minutes.\n\n#### 815", "answer_solution_perturbed": "815"}
