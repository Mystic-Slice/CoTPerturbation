{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemma-3-4b-it", "completed_solution_clean": "Next, we calculate the total cost of the two meals: 2 * 25 = 50.\nThen, we determine the amount of the tip needed to cover 80% of the tip for the two meals. 80% of 20% of the total cost is calculated as follows: 0.80 * 0.20 * 50 = 0.16 * 50 = 8.\nTherefore, Billy has to pay $8 in tips.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Billy and Jenny are ordering two meals, so the total cost of the meals is 2 * 25 = $50.\nThey want to cover 80% of a 20% tip, which means they want to cover 0.80 * 0.20 = 0.16 of the total cost of the meals.\nSo, the tip amount is 0.16 * 50 = $8.\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
