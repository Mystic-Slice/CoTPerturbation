{"id": 5897, "question": "Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?", "solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 toy cars\nGrandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 toy cars.\nAll the family together gave Olaf 10 +15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = <<10+15+6+5+10=46>>46.\nAdding the cars Olaf already had, Olaf's collection has 150 + 46 = <<150+46=196>>196 cars.\n#### 196", "clean_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars", "perturbed_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemma-3-4b-it", "completed_solution_clean": "Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle, so Grandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = 10 toy cars.\nOlaf initially had 150 cars.\nDad gave Olaf 10 toy cars.\nMum gave Olaf 15 toy cars.\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars.\nUncle gave Olaf 5 toy cars.\nGrandpa gave Olaf 10 toy cars.\nTotal cars = 150 + 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 150 + 46 = 196\n#### 196", "answer_solution_clean": "196", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle, so Grandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = 10 toy cars.\nOlaf initially had 150 cars.\nDad gave Olaf 10 toy cars.\nMum gave Olaf 15 toy cars.\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars.\nUncle gave Olaf 5 toy cars.\nGrandpa gave Olaf 10 toy cars.\nTotal cars = 150 + 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 196\n#### 196", "answer_solution_perturbed": "196"}
