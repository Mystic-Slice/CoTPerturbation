This is correct.

This is incorrect. The problem states that Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, so their ages are not the same.\n\nLet's verify the solution:\nRachel's age is 19 and Leah's age is 15.\nRachel is 4 years older than Leah: $19 - 15 = 4$.\nThe sum of their ages is $19 + 15 = 34$.\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "19"}
