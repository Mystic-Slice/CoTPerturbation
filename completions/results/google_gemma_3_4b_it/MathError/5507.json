{"id": 5507, "question": "John's weight bench can support 1000 pounds.  He wants to make sure to stay 20% under that weight for safety.  If he weighs 250 pounds how much weight can he put on the bar?", "solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=<<1000*.2=200>>200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=<<1000-200=800>>800 pounds\nThat means he can put 800-250=<<800-250=550>>550 pounds on the bar\n#### 550", "clean_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=800 pounds", "perturbed_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=291 pounds", "answer": 800.0, "perturbed_answer": 291.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemma-3-4b-it", "completed_solution_clean": "He weighs 250 pounds, and he wants to stay 800 pounds under the maximum weight capacity.
