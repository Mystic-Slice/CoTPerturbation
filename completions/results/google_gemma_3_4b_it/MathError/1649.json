{"id": 1649, "question": "In a field of 500 clovers, 20% have four leaves and one quarter of these are purple clovers. Assuming these proportions are exactly correct, how many clovers in the field are both purple and four-leaved?", "solution": "There are 500/5= <<500/5=100>>100 four leaf clovers\nThere are 100/4= <<100/4=25>>25 purple four leaf clovers\n#### 25", "clean_solution": "There are 500/5= 100 four leaf clovers", "perturbed_solution": "There are 500/5= 360 four leaf clovers", "answer": 100.0, "perturbed_answer": 360.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemma-3-4b-it", "completed_solution_clean": "Let the total number of clovers in the field be 500.\nThe percentage of clovers with four leaves is 20%, so the number of four-leaved clovers is 20% of 500.\nNumber of four-leaved clovers = 0.20 * 500 = 100.\nOne quarter of these four-leaved clovers are purple.\nNumber of purple four-leaved clovers = (1/4) * 100 = 25.\nTherefore, there are 25 clovers in the field that are both purple and four-leaved.\n\n#### 25", "answer_solution_clean": "25", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let the total number of clovers in the field be 500.\nThe percentage of clovers with four leaves is 20%, so the number of four-leaved clovers is 20% of 500.\nNumber of four-leaved clovers = 0.20 * 500 = 100.\nOne quarter of these four-leaved clovers are purple.\nNumber of purple four-leaved clovers = (1/4) * 100 = 25.\nTherefore, the number of clovers in the field that are both purple and four-leaved is 25.\n\nThe partial solution states that there are 500/5 = 100 four-leaf clovers. However, the problem states that 20% of the 500 clovers have four leaves. So, the number of four-leaf clovers is 0.20 * 500 = 100.\nOne quarter of these four-leaved clovers are purple. So, the number of purple four-leaved clovers is (1/4) * 100 = 25.\n\nThe partial solution states that there are 500/5 = 100 four leaf clovers. This is incorrect. The correct calculation is 20% of 500, which is 100.\nThe number of four-leaf clovers is 0.20 * 500 = 100.\nOne quarter of these are purple, so the number of purple four-leaf clovers is (1/4) * 100 = 25.\n\n#### 25", "answer_solution_perturbed": "25"}
