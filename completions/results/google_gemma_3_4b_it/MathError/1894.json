{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog-walking.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 71 hours spent dog-walking.", "answer": 24.0, "perturbed_answer": 71.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemma-3-4b-it", "completed_solution_clean": "Charlotte has 32 - 24 = 8 hours remaining.\nLet $x$ be the number of poodles she walks on Tuesday.\nIt takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, so walking $x$ poodles takes $2x$ hours.\nThe total time spent dog-walking this week is:\nMonday: 8 hours (poodles) + 2 hours (Chihuahuas) = 10 hours\nTuesday: $2x$ hours (poodles) + 2 hours (Chihuahuas) = $2x + 2$ hours\nWednesday: 12 hours (Labradors)\nTotal time: $10 + (2x + 2) + 12 = 32$\n$2x + 24 = 32$\n$2x = 32 - 24$\n$2x = 8$\n$x = 4$\nCharlotte can walk 4 poodles on Tuesday.\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The partial solution incorrectly calculates the total hours spent dog-walking. Let's recalculate the total hours.\n\nOn Monday, she walks 4 poodles at 2 hours/poodle, so she spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours walking poodles. She walks 2 Chihuahuas at 1 hour/Chihuahua, so she spends 2 * 1 = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas. Total hours on Monday = 8 + 2 = 10 hours.\n\nOn Tuesday, she walks the same number of Chihuahuas as Monday, which is 2. She walks them for 1 hour each, so she spends 2 * 1 = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas. Let 'x' be the number of poodles she walks. She walks them for 2 hours each, so she spends 2x hours walking poodles. Total hours on Tuesday = 2 + 2x.\n\nOn Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors at 3 hours/Labrador, so she spends 4 * 3 = 12 hours walking Labradors.\n\nThe total time spent dog-walking for the week is 10 + (2 + 2x) + 12 = 24 + 2x. We are given that she has a total of 32 hours available. So, 24 + 2x = 32.\n\nSubtracting 24 from both sides, we get 2x = 32 - 24 = 8.\n\nDividing by 2, we get x = 8 / 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, Charlotte can walk 4 poodles on Tuesday.\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
