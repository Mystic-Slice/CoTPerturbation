If the sum of their ages is 34, how old is Rachel?", "solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = <<34-4=30>>30.\nSo Leah would be 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 years old.\nHence, Rachel is 15 + 4 = <<15+4=19>>19 years old.\n#### 19", "clean_solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 30.", "perturbed_solution": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 68.", "answer": 30.0, "perturbed_answer": 68.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemma-3-4b-it", "completed_solution_clean": "Let Rachel's age be $r$ and Leah's age be $l$.\nWe are given that Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, so $r = l + 4$.\nWe are also given that the sum of their ages is 34, so $r + l = 34$.\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for $l$:\n$(l + 4) + l = 34$\n$2l + 4 = 34$\n$2l = 30$\n$l = 15$\nNow we can find Rachel's age using the equation $r = l + 4$:\n$r = 15 + 4$\n$r = 19$\nSo Rachel is 19 years old.\n\nThe partial solution states that if Rachel and Leah had the same age, the sum of their ages would be $34 - 4 = 30$. This is correct.
