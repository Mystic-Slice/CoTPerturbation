{"id": 1034, "question": "When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?", "solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 cups of cream cheese.\nShe uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\nFor each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eggs.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.", "perturbed_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 10 times her ratio.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 10.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemma-3-4b-it", "completed_solution_clean": "Let $s$ be the amount of sugar used, and $c$ be the amount of cream cheese used.\nThe ratio of sugar to cream cheese is 1:4, so $\\frac{s}{c} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nWe are given that Betty used 2 cups of sugar, so $s = 2$.\nWe can find the amount of cream cheese used: $\\frac{2}{c} = \\frac{1}{4}$, which implies $c = 2 \\times 4 = 8$ cups of cream cheese.\n\nBetty uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese.\nSo, the amount of vanilla used is $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$ teaspoons.\n\nShe uses 2 eggs for every 1 teaspoon of vanilla.\nSo, the number of eggs used is $4 \\times 2 = 8$ eggs.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let $s$ be the amount of sugar used, and $c$ be the amount of cream cheese used.\nThe ratio of sugar to cream cheese is 1:4, so $\\frac{s}{c} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nWe are given that Betty used 2 cups of sugar, so $s = 2$.\nWe can find the amount of cream cheese used: $\\frac{2}{c} = \\frac{1}{4}$, which implies $c = 2 \\times 4 = 8$ cups of cream cheese.\n\nBetty uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese.\nSo, the amount of vanilla used is $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$ teaspoons.\n\nFor every 1 teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs.\nSo, the number of eggs used is $4 \\times 2 = 8$ eggs.\n\nAlternatively, we are given that Betty used 2 cups of sugar. Since the ratio of sugar to cream cheese is 1:4, we have $s:c = 1:4$. Thus, $c = 4s = 4(2) = 8$ cups of cream cheese.\nBetty flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. So, the number of teaspoons of vanilla is $\\frac{8 \\text{ cups}}{2 \\text{ cups/teaspoon}} = 4$ teaspoons.\nShe uses two eggs for every one teaspoon of vanilla.
