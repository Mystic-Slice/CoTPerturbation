{"id": 957, "question": "A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?", "solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240", "clean_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.", "perturbed_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 639 coals.", "answer": 180.0, "perturbed_answer": 639.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemma-3-4b-it", "completed_solution_clean": "The grill burned 180 coals.\nIt burns 15 coals to ash in 20 minutes.\nSo, the rate of burning is 15/20 = 3/4 coals per minute.\nTo burn 180 coals, the time taken is 180 * (4/3) = 60 * 4 = 240 minutes.\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 / 60 = 4 hours.\n\n#### 240", "answer_solution_clean": "240", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The grill burns 15 coals per 20 minutes. We can find the rate of burning coals in coals per minute by dividing 15 by 20, which is 0.75 coals per minute.\n\nThe grill burned 639 coals. To find the time it took to burn these coals, we can divide the total number of coals by the rate of burning:\nTime = Total coals / Rate of burning\nTime = 639 / 0.75\nTime = 852 minutes\n\nNow, we need to convert minutes to hours and minutes.\n852 minutes = 14 hours and 12 minutes (since 852 = 14 * 60 + 12)\n\nAlternatively, we can set up a proportion:\n$\\frac{15 \\text{ coals}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{639 \\text{ coals}}{x \\text{ minutes}}$\nCross-multiply:\n$15x = 20 \\cdot 639$\n$15x = 12780$\n$x = \\frac{12780}{15}$\n$x = 852$ minutes\n\nNow convert 852 minutes to hours and minutes:\n852 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 14 hours and 12 minutes.\n\n#### 852", "answer_solution_perturbed": "852"}
