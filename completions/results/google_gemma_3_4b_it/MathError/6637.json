If eight liters represents 20% of the container's capacity, then the full capacity is 8 / 0.20 = 40 liters.  Therefore, 40 containers each with a capacity of 40 liters will have a total capacity of 40 * 40 = 1600 liters.\n\nOops, I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Let's redo it.\n\nIf 8 liters is 20% of the container's capacity, then the full capacity is 8 / 0.20 = 40 liters.\nThe total capacity of 40 containers is 40 * 40 = 1600 liters.\n\n#### 1600", "answer_solution_perturbed": "1600"}
