{"id": 5661, "question": "The civic league was hosting a pancake breakfast fundraiser.  A stack of pancakes was $4.00 and you could add bacon for $2.00.  They sold 60 stacks of pancakes and 90 slices of bacon.  How much did they raise?", "solution": "The pancakes were $4.00 a stack and they sold 60 stacks for a total of 4*60 = $<<4*60=240.00>>240.00\nThe bacon was $2.00 a slice and they sold 90 slices for a total of 2*90 = $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00\nThey sold $240 in pancakes and $180 in bacon for a total of 240+180 = $<<240+180=420.00>>420.00\n#### 420", "clean_solution": "The pancakes were $4.00 a stack and they sold 60 stacks for a total of 4*60 = $240.00\nThe bacon was $2.00 a slice and they sold 90 slices for a total of 2*90 = $180.00", "perturbed_solution": "The pancakes were $4.00 a stack and they sold 60 stacks for a total of 4*60 = $240.00\nThe bacon was $2.00 a slice and they sold 90 slices for a total of 2*90 = $3670", "answer": 180.0, "perturbed_answer": 3670.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "google/gemma-3-4b-it", "completed_solution_clean": "The total amount raised is the sum of the money from the pancakes and the bacon.
