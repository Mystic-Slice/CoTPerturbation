{"id": 3080, "question": "Tony has two fish. Every year, his parents buy him two more, but one of them dies.

Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nInitially, Tony has 2 fish.\nEach year, he gets 2 new fish and 1 fish dies. So the net increase in fish is 2 - 1 = 1 fish per year.\n\nYear 1: 2 + 1 = 3 fish\nYear 2: 3 + 1 = 4 fish\nYear 3: 4 + 1 = 5 fish\nYear 4: 5 + 1 = 6 fish\nYear 5: 6 + 1 = 7 fish\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the total increase over 5 years: 5 * 1 = 5.\nThen add this to the initial number of fish: 2 + 5 = 7.\n\n#### 7", "answer_solution_perturbed": "7"}
