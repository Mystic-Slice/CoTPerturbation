{"id": 4275, "question": "Scott, Mary, and Ken committed to raising $4,000 for their local children\u2019s cancer hospital. Right now, Mary\u2019s collection is five times what Ken has, but three times Scott\u2019s funds.

Since the question asks by how much they *exceeded* their goal, and they actually fell short, the answer is -$1167. However, the problem implies they exceeded the goal, so let's re-examine the calculations.\n\nMary has collected 5 * $600 = $3000\nScott therefore has $3000 / 3 = $1000\nAll together, they have raised $3000 + $1000 + $600 = $4600\nThey exceeded their goal by $4600 - $4000 = $600.\n\n#### 600", "answer_solution_perturbed": "600"}
