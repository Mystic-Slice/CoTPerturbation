He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.\n\nThen, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters. So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 540\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `3 * 60 = 180 meters` to modify. I will change the unit from meters to centimeters. I will change the number 180 to 18000 because from the given conversionFactors, it is known that 1 meter = 100 centimeter.

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is speed * time, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.\n\nNext, he spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is again speed * time, so he drives 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\nFinally, he spends the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is speed * time, so he drives 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nSo, in total, during the 4 hours of his return trip, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles towards home.\n\nHowever, he was initially 180 miles away from home. So, at the end of those 4 hours, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours` to modify.

The gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons.\nHis car gets 18 miles per gallon, so he can travel 18 gallons * 18 miles/gallon = 324 miles on a full tank.\nSince he is driving 600 miles, he will need to refuel at least once.\nThe distance he travels before needing to refuel is 324 miles.\nThe time to travel 324 miles at 50 miles per hour is 324 miles / 50 miles per hour = 6.48 hours = 6 hours and 29 minutes (0.48 * 60 = 28.8).\nHe takes a 15-minute rest stop after every 2 hours of driving.\nSo, he drives for 6.48 hours, which is 6 hours and 29 minutes.\nThe number of 2-hour intervals is 6 hours / 2 hours = 3 intervals.\nSo, he takes 3 rest stops of 15 minutes each, which is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.\nThe time to travel 324 miles is 6.48 hours, and the rest stop time is 45 minutes.\nTotal time for the first leg is 6.48 hours + 45 minutes = 6 hours, 74 minutes.\nRemaining distance is 600 - 324 = 276 miles.\nThe time to travel 276 miles is 276 miles / 50 miles per hour = 5.52 hours = 5 hours and 31 minutes (0.52 * 60 = 31.2).\nThe number of 2-hour intervals is 5 hours / 2 hours = 2.5 intervals.\nSo, he takes 2 rest stops of 15 minutes each, which is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.\nThe total time for the second leg is 5.52 hours + 30 minutes = 5 hours, 60 minutes = 6 hours.\nTotal time for the trip is 6 hours 74 minutes + 6 hours = 12 hours 34 minutes.\nIn minutes, this is (12 * 60) + 74 + 60 = 720 + 74 + 60 = 854 minutes.\n\nLet's recalculate the total time.\nDriving time = 600 miles / 50 mph = 12 hours.\nNumber of rest stops = 12 hours / 2 hours = 6 rest stops.\nTotal rest stop time = 6 * 15 minutes = 90 minutes.\nGas stops:\nThe car gets 18 miles per gallon.\nTotal gallons needed = 600 miles / 18 miles/gallon = 33.33 gallons.\nSince the gas indicator comes on at 15 gallons, he needs to refuel twice.\nRefueling time = 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes.\nTotal time = Driving time + Rest stop time + Refueling time\nTotal time = 12 hours + 90 minutes + 20 minutes = 12 hours + 110 minutes = 12 hours + 1 hour 50 minutes = 13 hours 50 minutes.\nIn minutes, this is (13 * 60) + 50 = 780 + 50 = 830 minutes.\n\nThe car gets 18 miles per gallon.\nTotal distance = 600 miles.\nTotal gallons needed = 600/18 = 33.33 gallons.\nHe starts with a full tank.

Jeremy takes a rest stop every 2 hours of driving. In 12 hours, the number of 2-hour intervals is 12 hours / 2 hours/interval = 6 intervals. So, he takes 6 rest stops.\n\nThe total rest stop time is 6 rest stops * 15 minutes/rest stop = 90 minutes.\n\nThe time to refill the gas is 10 minutes.

So, he refills when he has used 15 gallons.\nThe number of refills is the number of 15-gallon increments used.\nSince he uses 600 miles and gets 18 miles per gallon, he uses 600/18 = 33.33 gallons.\nHe refills when he uses 15 gallons. So he refills 33.33/15 = 2.22 times.\nSince he refills after every 2 hours of driving, and he takes 12 hours to drive, he refills 6 times.\nThe time to refill is 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes.\n\nThe total time taken is the driving time plus the rest stop time and refill time.\nDriving time = 12 hours = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.\nRest stop time = 6 * 15 = 90 minutes.\nRefill time = 6 * 10 = 60 minutes.\nTotal time = 720 + 90 + 60 = 870 minutes.\n\n####870", "answer_solution_perturbed": "invalid"}
