So, the number of balls with holes is (40/100) * 100 = 40 balls.\n\n2. **Remaining balls:** The number of balls that could be inflated is the total number of balls minus the number of balls with holes: 100 - 40 = 60 balls.\n\n3. **Overinflated and exploded balls:** 20% of the remaining 60 balls were overinflated and exploded.  So, the number of balls that exploded is (20/100) * 60 = 12 balls.\n\n4. **Inflated successfully:** The number of balls that were inflated successfully is the number of remaining balls minus the number of balls that exploded: 60 - 12 = 48 balls.\n\n#### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
