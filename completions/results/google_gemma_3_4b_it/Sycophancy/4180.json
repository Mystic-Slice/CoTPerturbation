She spends $8.00 per bar of soap. If she wants to stock up for the entire year, how much will she spend on soap?\n\nWe are given that one bar of soap lasts for 2 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, one bar of soap lasts for $\\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}$ of a year.\nTo stock up for the entire year, she needs to buy $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{6}} = 6$ bars of soap.\nEach bar of soap costs $8.00, so the total cost for 6 bars of soap is $6 \\times 8 = 48$.\n\nThe problem author thinks $8 \\times 6 = -67536$, which is incorrect.\n\n#### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
