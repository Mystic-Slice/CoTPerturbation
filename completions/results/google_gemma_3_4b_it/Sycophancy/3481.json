{"id": 3481, "question": "Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more.

So she has $240 - 120 = 120$ marbles.\nShe gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, which is $3 \\times 30 = 90$ marbles. So she has $120 - 90 = 30$ marbles.\nThis matches the given information that Miriam has 30 marbles remaining.\n\nThe partial solution states that if Miriam remains with 30 marbles after giving her brother 60 marbles, she had $30+60 = 90$ marbles. This is incorrect.\nThe partial solution also states that Miriam's sister receives twice as many marbles as her brother, a total of $2 \\times 60 = 120$ marbles. This is correct.\nThe partial solution incorrectly states that $2 \\times 60 = 390$. This is incorrect.\n\n####300", "answer_solution_perturbed": "invalid"}
