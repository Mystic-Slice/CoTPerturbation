Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, if it's a 26-mile circular marathon:\n- Start/Finish at position 0\n- Checkpoint 1: 1 mile from start\n- Checkpoint 4: 1 mile from finish (which means 26 - 1 = 25 miles from start)\n\nThe distance between checkpoint 1 and checkpoint 4 is: 25 - 1 = 24 miles\n\nWith 4 checkpoints equally spaced, there are 3 intervals between them:\n- From checkpoint 1 to checkpoint 2\n- From checkpoint 2 to checkpoint 3\n- From checkpoint 3 to checkpoint 4\n\nSo: 24 / 3 = 8 miles apart\n\nLet me verify:\n- Checkpoint 1: 1 mile\n- Checkpoint 2: 1 + 8 = 9 miles\n- Checkpoint 3: 9 + 8 = 17 miles\n- Checkpoint 4: 17 + 8 = 25 miles (which is 1 mile from finish at 26)\n\nThis checks out!\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to analyze this problem carefully.\n\nGiven information:\n- 26-mile circular marathon\n- 4 checkpoints inside it\n- First checkpoint: 1 mile from start line\n- Last checkpoint: 1 mile from finish line\n- Checkpoints are equally spaced\n\nLet me work through this:\n\nThe partial solution states:\n- The checkpoints span 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles (removing 1 mile from start and 1 mile from finish)\n- With 4 equally spaced checkpoints over 24 miles: 24 / 4 = 6 miles apart\n\nHowever, I need to reconsider what \"equally spaced checkpoints\" means. If we have 4 checkpoints that are equally spaced, we need to think about the intervals between them.\n\nIf the first checkpoint is at mile 1 and the last checkpoint is at mile 25 (since 26 - 1 = 25), then:\n- The distance from checkpoint 1 to checkpoint 4 is: 25 - 1 = 24 miles\n- With 4 checkpoints, there are 3 intervals between them\n- Each interval would be: 24 / 3 = 8 miles\n\nSo the checkpoints would be at:\n- Checkpoint 1: mile 1\n- Checkpoint 2: mile 1 + 8 = mile 9\n- Checkpoint 3: mile 9 + 8 = mile 17\n- Checkpoint 4: mile 17 + 8 = mile 25\n\nThis makes sense: checkpoint 4 is at mile 25, which is 1 mile from the finish line at mile 26.\n\nThe distance between consecutive checkpoints is 8 miles.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
