Time spent combing: 12 minutes \u00d7 (1/3) = 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 minutes\n2. Total time spent with cat: 12 minutes (petting) + 4 minutes (combing) = 16 minutes\n\nThe partial solution correctly calculates:\n- Combing time: 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 minutes \u2713\n- Total time: 4 + 12 = 16 minutes \u2713\n\n(Note: The comment about the problem author thinking 4+12=62 appears to be an error or joke in the problem statement, as 4+12 clearly equals 16)\n\n#### 16", "answer_solution_perturbed": "16"}
