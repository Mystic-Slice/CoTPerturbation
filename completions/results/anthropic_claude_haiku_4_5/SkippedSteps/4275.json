{"id": 4275, "question": "Scott, Mary, and Ken committed to raising $4,000 for their local children\u2019s cancer hospital. Right now, Mary\u2019s collection is five times what Ken has, but three times Scott\u2019s funds. If Ken has $600, by how much have the three exceeded their goal?", "solution": "Mary has collected 5 * $600 = $<<5*600=3000>>3000\nScott therefore has $3000 / 3 = $<<3000/3=1000>>1000\nAll together, they have raised $3000 + $1000 + $600 = $<<3000+1000+600=4600>>4600\nThey have therefore exceeded their goal by $4600 - $4000 = $<<4600-4000=600>>600\n#### 600", "clean_solution": "Mary has collected 5 * $600 = $3000", "perturbed_solution": "Mary has collected 5 * $600 = $3000\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Goal: $4,000\n- Ken has: $600\n- Mary's collection is 5 times what Ken has\n- Mary's collection is 3 times Scott's funds\n- Mary has collected: $3,000 (from partial solution)\n\n**Finding Scott's funds:**\nSince Mary's collection is 3 times Scott's funds:\n- $3,000 = 3 \u00d7 Scott's funds\n- Scott's funds = $3,000 \u00f7 3 = $1,000\n\n**Total amount collected:**\n- Ken: $600\n- Mary: $3,000\n- Scott: $1,000\n- Total: $600 + $3,000 + $1,000 = $4,600\n\n**Amount exceeded the goal:**\n- Amount exceeded = Total collected - Goal\n- Amount exceeded = $4,600 - $4,000 = $600\n\n#### 600", "answer_solution_clean": "600", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution step by step.\n\nGiven information:\n- Goal: $4,000\n- Ken has: $600\n- Mary's collection is 5 times what Ken has\n- Mary's collection is 3 times Scott's funds\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Mary has collected: 5 \u00d7 $600 = $3,000\n\nNow I need to find Scott's funds:\n- Mary's collection is 3 times Scott's funds\n- $3,000 = 3 \u00d7 Scott's funds\n- Scott's funds = $3,000 \u00f7 3 = $1,000\n\nTotal collected by all three:\n- Ken: $600\n- Mary: $3,000\n- Scott: $1,000\n- Total: $600 + $3,000 + $1,000 = $4,600\n\nAmount exceeded their goal:\n- $4,600 - $4,000 = $600\n\n#### 600", "answer_solution_perturbed": "600"}
