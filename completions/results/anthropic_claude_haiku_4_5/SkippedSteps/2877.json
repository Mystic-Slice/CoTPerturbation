{"id": 2877, "question": "Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?", "solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = <<1500/75=20>>20\nThe second route will take 30 hours because 750 / 25 = <<750/25=30>>30\nThe fastest route takes 20 hours because 20 < 30\n#### 20", "clean_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20", "perturbed_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to find how long the fastest route takes.\n\nFrom the partial solution, I know:\n- First route: 1,500 miles \u00f7 75 MPH = 20 hours\n\nNow let me calculate the second route:\n- Second route: 750 miles \u00f7 25 MPH = 30 hours\n\nComparing the two routes:\n- First route: 20 hours\n- Second route: 30 hours\n\nThe fastest route is the first route, which takes 20 hours.\n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_clean": "20", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution by finding the time for the second route and determining which is faster.\n\n**First route:** 1,500 miles \u00f7 75 MPH = 20 hours \u2713\n\n**Second route:** 750 miles \u00f7 25 MPH = 30 hours\n\n**Comparing the routes:**\n- Route 1: 20 hours\n- Route 2: 30 hours\n\nThe fastest route is Route 1, which takes 20 hours.\n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_perturbed": "20"}
