{"id": 2540, "question": "Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years.

The problem says \"will be three times as much in another three years.\" This means the future price will be three times the original purchase price of $4000.\n\nSo in three years from now: $12000\n\nThe question asks: \"How much money will the art piece have increased by?\"\n\nThis is asking for the total increase from the original purchase price to the future price:\nIncrease = $12000 - $4000 = $8000\n\nThe partial solution correctly calculated this as $8000.\n\n#### 8000", "answer_solution_clean": "8000", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution by verifying the logic and providing the final answer.\n\nLet me trace through the problem:\n- Three years ago, Rosie purchased the art piece for $4000\n- In another three years (from now), the art piece will be three times as much as its buying price\n- The buying price was $4000\n- So in three years, it will be worth: 3 \u00d7 $4000 = $12000\n\nThe increase in value from the original purchase price to the future price is:\n$12000 - $4000 = $8000\n\nThe partial solution correctly identifies that the art piece will increase by $8000.\n\n#### 8000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8000"}
