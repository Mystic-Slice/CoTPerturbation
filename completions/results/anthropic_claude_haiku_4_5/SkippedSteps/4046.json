{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution:** For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nNow I need to find the total earnings for both months:\n- First month: $200\n- Second month: $350\n- Total earnings: $200 + $350 = $550\n\nSince Sam earns $10 per hour, I can find the total hours by dividing total earnings by hourly rate:\n- Total hours = Total earnings \u00f7 Hourly rate\n- Total hours = $550 \u00f7 $10\n- Total hours = 55 hours\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution:** For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nTotal earnings for two months = $200 + $350 = $550\n\nSince Sam earns $10 an hour, the number of hours spent on tutoring is:\nNumber of hours = Total earnings \u00f7 Hourly rate\nNumber of hours = $550 \u00f7 $10 = 55 hours\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_perturbed": "55"}
