{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Total flour: 6 pounds\n- Flour for cakes: 4 pounds (0.5 pounds per cake)\n- Flour for cupcakes: 2 pounds (1/5 pounds per cupcake)\n- Price per cake: $2.5\n- Price per cupcake: $1\n\n**Partial solution completed:**\nGary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nNow I need to find how many cupcakes Gary can bake with the remaining 2 pounds of flour.\n\nNumber of cupcakes = 2 \u00f7 (1/5) = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 cupcakes\n\n**Calculating total earnings:**\n\nEarnings from cakes = 8 cakes \u00d7 $2.5 per cake = $20\n\nEarnings from cupcakes = 10 cupcakes \u00d7 $1 per cupcake = $10\n\nTotal earnings = $20 + $10 = $30\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution Given:**\nGary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nNow I need to find how many cupcakes Gary can make with the remaining 2 pounds of flour.\n\nEach cupcake requires 1/5 pounds of flour.\n\nNumber of cupcakes = 2 \u00f7 (1/5) = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 cupcakes\n\n**Calculating earnings:**\n\nFrom cakes: 8 cakes \u00d7 $2.5 per cake = $20\n\nFrom cupcakes: 10 cupcakes \u00d7 $1 per cupcake = $10\n\nTotal earnings = $20 + $10 = $30\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
