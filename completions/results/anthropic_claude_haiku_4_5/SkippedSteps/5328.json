{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to continue from the partial solution and account for the repeated players.\n\n**Partial Solution Analysis:**\n- Mona joined 9 groups with 4 other players each\n- Initial count: 9 \u00d7 4 = 36 player instances\n\n**Accounting for Repeats:**\nNow I need to subtract the players she had grouped with before:\n\n1.
