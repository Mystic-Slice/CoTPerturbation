{"id": 3018, "question": "Kara has to drink 4 ounces of water every time she takes her medication. Her medication instructions are to take one tablet three times a day. She followed the instructions for one week, but in the second week, she forgot twice on one day. How many ounces of water did she drink with her medication over those two weeks?", "solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = <<84*2=168>>168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = <<168-8=160>>160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.", "perturbed_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution Summary:**\n- Kara drinks 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ounces of water per day (when taking medication as instructed)\n- In one week, she drinks 12 \u00d7 7 = 84 ounces of water\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\n**Week 1:** She followed instructions perfectly\n- Water consumed: 84 ounces\n\n**Week 2:** She forgot twice on one day\n- Days she followed instructions: 6 days \u00d7 12 ounces = 72 ounces\n- Day she forgot twice: She was supposed to take medication 3 times but only took it 1 time (3 - 2 = 1)\n  - Water consumed that day: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4 ounces\n- Total for week 2: 72 + 4 = 76 ounces\n\n**Total over two weeks:**\n84 + 76 = 160 ounces\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution Summary:**\n- Kara drinks 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ounces of water per day (4 ounces \u00d7 3 tablets per day)\n- In one week, she drinks 12 \u00d7 7 = 84 ounces of water\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nWeek 1: She followed instructions perfectly\n- Water consumed in Week 1 = 84 ounces\n\nWeek 2: She forgot twice on one day\n- This means on one day in Week 2, she only took 1 tablet instead of 3 tablets\n- On that day, she drank: 4 \u00d7 1 = 4 ounces (instead of 12 ounces)\n- The other 6 days of Week 2, she drank normally: 12 \u00d7 6 = 72 ounces\n- Water consumed in Week 2 = 72 + 4 = 76 ounces\n\n**Total over two weeks:**\n84 + 76 = 160 ounces\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_perturbed": "160"}
