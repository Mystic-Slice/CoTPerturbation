The problem states \"56 sheep and goats\" which means sheep + goats = 56 total.\n\nThe correct interpretation should be:\n- Total animals = 200\n- Cows = 40\n- Sheep and goats combined = 56\n- Other animals = 200 - 40 - 56 = 104\n\nBut the question asks specifically for the number of goats, and we're only told that sheep and goats together equal 56. Without knowing how many sheep there are specifically, we cannot determine the exact number of goats.\n\nHowever, following the partial solution's logic as presented:\n- Animals that are NOT goats = Cows + Sheep = 40 + (56 - goats)\n- But if we interpret \"56 sheep and goats\" as the combined total, then:\n- Goats = 200 - 40 - (sheep) \n\nGiven the partial solution's calculation: 200 - 96 = 104\n\n#### 104", "answer_solution_clean": "104", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll complete this solution.\n\nGiven information:\n- Total animals: 200\n- Cows: 40\n- Sheep and goats combined: 56\n\nThe partial solution states:\n- Animals other than goats (cows + sheep): 56 + 40 = 96\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The problem states \"56 sheep and goats\" - this means sheep and goats together total 56.\n\nSo the animals other than goats would be:\n- Cows: 40\n- Sheep: (part of the 56)\n\nActually, looking at the partial solution more carefully: it says \"56 + 40 = 96 animals other than goats\"\n\nThis means:\n- 40 cows\n- 56 sheep (the \"sheep and goats\" statement means 56 is just the sheep count, or the problem is interpreted as 56 being sheep only)\n\nIf 56 + 40 = 96 are animals other than goats, then:\n- Goats = 200 - 96 = 104\n\n#### 104", "answer_solution_perturbed": "104"}
