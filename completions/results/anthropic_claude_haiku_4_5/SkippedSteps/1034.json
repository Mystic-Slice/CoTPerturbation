{"id": 1034, "question": "When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?", "solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 cups of cream cheese.\nShe uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\nFor each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eggs.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese.", "perturbed_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Sugar to cream cheese ratio: 1:4\n- Vanilla to cream cheese: 1 teaspoon per 2 cups\n- Eggs to vanilla: 2 eggs per 1 teaspoon\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n\n**From the partial solution:**\n- Betty used 8 cups of cream cheese\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nStep 1: Find how much vanilla was used.\n- Ratio: 1 teaspoon vanilla per 2 cups cream cheese\n- Cream cheese used: 8 cups\n- Vanilla used: 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla\n\nStep 2: Find how many eggs were used.\n- Ratio: 2 eggs per 1 teaspoon vanilla\n- Vanilla used: 4 teaspoons\n- Eggs used: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 eggs\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\nGiven information:\n- Sugar to cream cheese ratio: 1:4\n- Vanilla to cream cheese: 1 teaspoon per 2 cups\n- Eggs to vanilla: 2 eggs per 1 teaspoon\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n- Since the ratio is 1:4, she used 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese\n\nNow I'll continue:\n\n**Step 1: Find the amount of vanilla used**\n- Ratio: 1 teaspoon vanilla per 2 cups cream cheese\n- She used 8 cups of cream cheese\n- Vanilla needed: 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of eggs used**\n- Ratio: 2 eggs per 1 teaspoon of vanilla\n- She used 4 teaspoons of vanilla\n- Eggs needed: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 eggs\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
