{"id": 997, "question": "Ittymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?", "solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.\nIf they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.", "perturbed_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to continue from the partial solution and find how many fish each person gets to eat.\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nFrom the partial solution: There are 24 eyes total.\n\nSince each fish has 2 eyes, the total number of fish is:\n- Total fish = 24 eyes \u00f7 2 eyes per fish = 12 fish\n\nThe fish are split equally among three people (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck):\n- Fish per person = 12 fish \u00f7 3 = 4 fish per person\n\nHowever, I need to account for what each person actually eats:\n\n**Ittymangnark:** Gets 4 fish to eat = 4 fish\n\n**Kingnook:** Gets 4 fish to eat = 4 fish\n\n**Oomyapeck:** Gets 4 fish, but then gives away the eyes (24 eyes total). \n- Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes (which come from the 24 eyes from his 4 fish)\n- So Oomyapeck eats: 4 fish minus the 2 eyes he gave to the dog\n- Since each fish has 2 eyes, and 2 eyes went to the dog, that's 1 fish's worth of eyes\n- Oomyapeck eats: 4 fish - 1 fish (in eye equivalent) = 3 fish worth of meat (plus 22 eyes)\n\nWait, let me reconsider.
