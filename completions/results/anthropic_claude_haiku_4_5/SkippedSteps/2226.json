{"id": 2226, "question": "Every week of last month Paul tried out a new cake recipe.  The first week, he followed a cake recipe that called for 24 cups of sugar. Each week after that, he reduced the amount of sugar by half. How much sugar did he use for the cake on the fourth week?", "solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = <<24/2=12>>12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups\nThe fourth week, he used 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cups\n#### 3", "clean_solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups", "perturbed_solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Week 1: 24 cups of sugar\n- Each week after, the amount is reduced by half\n- Week 2: 24/2 = 12 cups (as stated in partial solution)\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nWeek 3: Paul halves the week 2 amount\n- Week 3 sugar = 12/2 = 6 cups\n\nWeek 4: Paul halves the week 3 amount\n- Week 4 sugar = 6/2 = 3 cups\n\nTherefore, on the fourth week, Paul used 3 cups of sugar.\n\n#### 3", "answer_solution_clean": "3", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution Given:**\n- Week 1: 24 cups of sugar\n- Week 2: 24/2 = 12 cups of sugar\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nWeek 3: He reduced the amount from week 2 by half\n- Week 3: 12/2 = 6 cups of sugar\n\nWeek 4: He reduced the amount from week 3 by half\n- Week 4: 6/2 = 3 cups of sugar\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **3**\n\n#### 3", "answer_solution_perturbed": "3"}
