{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- First snail's speed: 2 feet per minute\n- Second snail's speed: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 feet per minute\n- Third snail's speed: 5 \u00d7 (second snail's speed) = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 feet per minute\n- First snail's time: 20 minutes\n\n**From the partial solution:**\n- Second snail's time: 20/2 = 10 minutes\n\n**Finding the distance:**\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance = 2 feet/minute \u00d7 20 minutes = 40 feet\n\n**Finding the third snail's time:**\nThe third snail travels at 20 feet per minute.\nTime = Distance \u00f7 Speed\nTime = 40 feet \u00f7 20 feet/minute = 2 minutes\n\nAlternatively, we can use the relationship that time is inversely proportional to speed:\n- Third snail's speed is 10 times the first snail's speed (20 \u00f7 2 = 10)\n- Therefore, third snail's time = 20 \u00f7 10 = 2 minutes\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution by finding how long it took the third snail.\n\n**Given information:**\n- First snail's speed: 2 feet per minute\n- Second snail's speed: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 feet per minute\n- Third snail's speed: 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 feet per minute\n- First snail's time: 20 minutes\n\n**Finding the distance:**\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance = 2 feet/minute \u00d7 20 minutes = 40 feet\n\n**Finding the third snail's time:**\nThe third snail travels at 20 feet per minute and needs to cover 40 feet.\n\nTime = Distance \u00f7 Speed\nTime = 40 feet \u00f7 20 feet/minute = 2 minutes\n\nAlternatively, using the pattern from the partial solution:\n- First snail takes 20 minutes at speed 2 ft/min\n- Second snail takes 10 minutes at speed 4 ft/min (twice the speed = half the time)\n- Third snail takes ? minutes at speed 20 ft/min (5 times the second snail's speed = 1/5 the time)\n\nTime for third snail = 10 \u00f7 5 = 2 minutes\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
