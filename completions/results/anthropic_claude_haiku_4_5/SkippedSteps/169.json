{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution:** Borris uses 90 \u00d7 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nNow I need to calculate how many grapes he needs after increasing production by 20%.\n\nCurrent yearly usage: 180 kilograms\n\nIncrease of 20%:\n- 20% of 180 = 0.20 \u00d7 180 = 36 kilograms\n\nNew yearly usage after increase:\n- 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution:** Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nNow, Borris is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent.\n\nIncrease amount = 20% of 180 kilograms\nIncrease amount = 0.20 \u00d7 180 = 36 kilograms\n\nNew amount needed per year = 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
