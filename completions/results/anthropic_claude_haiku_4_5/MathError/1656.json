{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 30 feet long", "answer": 75.0, "perturbed_answer": 30.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Fence length: 25 yards = 75 feet (from partial solution)\n- Tree width at maturity: 1.5 feet\n- Cost per tree: $8.00\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of trees needed**\n\nNumber of trees = Fence length \u00f7 Tree width\nNumber of trees = 75 feet \u00f7 1.5 feet\nNumber of trees = 50 trees\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost**\n\nTotal cost = Number of trees \u00d7 Cost per tree\nTotal cost = 50 \u00d7 $8.00\nTotal cost = $400.00\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_clean": "400", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to continue from where the partial solution left off.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Fence length: 25 yards = 75 feet (the partial solution has an error; let me recalculate: 3 feet/yard \u00d7 25 yards = 75 feet, not 30 feet)\n- Tree width at maturity: 1.5 feet\n- Cost per tree: $8.00\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nThe fence is actually 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 feet long (not 30 feet as stated in the partial solution).\n\nTo find how many trees are needed:\n- Number of trees = Fence length \u00f7 Tree width\n- Number of trees = 75 feet \u00f7 1.5 feet per tree\n- Number of trees = 50 trees\n\nTo find the total cost:\n- Total cost = Number of trees \u00d7 Cost per tree\n- Total cost = 50 \u00d7 $8.00\n- Total cost = $400.00\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_perturbed": "400"}
