{"id": 4600, "question": "Nick is trying to raise money for a charity. He is selling candy bars for $5. He is also selling chocolate oranges for $10. He wants to raise $1000. He only had 20 chocolate oranges that he sold out. How many candy bars does Nick need to sell to reach his goal?", "solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $<<20*10=200>>200 from the chocolate oranges.\nThis means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800.\nHe needs to sell a total of $800 / $5 = <<800/5=160>>160 candy bars to reach his goal.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $200 from the chocolate oranges.\nThis means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $800.", "perturbed_solution": "Nick has made 20 * $10 = $200 from the chocolate oranges.\nThis means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $348.", "answer": 800.0, "perturbed_answer": 348.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\nNick needs to raise another $800 from selling candy bars.\n\nSince each candy bar sells for $5, I need to find how many candy bars are needed:\n\nNumber of candy bars = $800 \u00f7 $5 = 160\n\nTherefore, Nick needs to sell 160 candy bars to reach his goal of $1000.\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to continue from where the partial solution left off.\n\nThe partial solution states:\n- Nick made $200 from selling 20 chocolate oranges\n- He needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $800 (note: there's an error in the partial solution which says $348, but it should be $800)\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- Total goal: $1000\n- Money from chocolate oranges: 20 \u00d7 $10 = $200\n- Money still needed: $1000 - $200 = $800\n\nNow, candy bars sell for $5 each.\n\nNumber of candy bars needed = $800 \u00f7 $5 = 160\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_perturbed": "160"}
