{"id": 4789, "question": "Since it is Maurice's turn to host this year\u2019s neighborhood cookout, he goes to the local wholesale club to buy ground beef. The wholesale club sells ground beef in 5-pound packages. Maurice wants to make one 2-pound burger for each person that attends, so he purchases 4 packages of ground beef. How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?", "solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = <<10-1=9>>9 people\n#### 9", "clean_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = 9 people", "perturbed_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = 1 people", "answer": 9.0, "perturbed_answer": 1.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll verify and complete this solution.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Ground beef comes in 5-pound packages\n- Maurice buys 4 packages\n- Each burger requires 2 pounds of ground beef\n- Maurice wants to include himself in the count\n\n**Solution:**\n\nStep 1: Calculate total ground beef purchased\n4 packages \u00d7 5 pounds per package = 20 pounds of ground beef \u2713\n\nStep 2: Calculate number of burgers that can be made\n20 pounds \u00f7 2 pounds per burger = 10 burgers \u2713\n\nStep 3: Determine how many people can attend (including Maurice)\nSince Maurice will have 1 burger and there are 10 burgers total, the total number of people who can attend (including Maurice himself) is 10 people.\n\nThe question asks \"How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?\"\n\nThis means:\n- Total people at cookout = 10 (including Maurice)\n- People Maurice can invite = 10 - 1 = 9 people\n\nThe partial solution correctly concludes that Maurice can invite 9 people.\n\n#### 9", "answer_solution_clean": "9", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution.
