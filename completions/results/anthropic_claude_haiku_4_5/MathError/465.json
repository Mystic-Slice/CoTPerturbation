{"id": 465, "question": "A man is returning home from work and trying to decide which route to take.  His first route option includes 3 stoplights.  This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.  If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?", "solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = <<10+3*3=19>>19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = <<19-14=5>>5 minutes longer than the second route.\n#### 5", "clean_solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = 19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = 5 minutes longer than the second route.", "perturbed_solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = 19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = 7 minutes longer than the second route.", "answer": 5.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll verify and complete this solution.\n\n**Given Information:**\n- First route: 10 minutes if all lights are green, plus 3 minutes for each red light\n- Second route: 14 minutes (no stoplights)\n- Question: How much longer will the trip be on the first route if all 3 stoplights are red?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nIf all 3 stoplights are red:\n- Base time: 10 minutes\n- Additional time: 3 minutes \u00d7 3 red lights = 9 minutes\n- Total time for first route: 10 + 9 = 19 minutes\n\nComparison with second route:\n- First route time: 19 minutes\n- Second route time: 14 minutes\n- Difference: 19 - 14 = 5 minutes\n\nThe first route will take **5 minutes longer** than the second route when all 3 stoplights are red.\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_clean": "5", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll verify and complete this solution.\n\n**Given Information:**\n- First route: 10 minutes if all lights are green, plus 3 minutes for each red light\n- Second route: 14 minutes (no stoplights)\n- Question: How much longer will the trip be on the first route if all 3 stoplights are red?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nIf all 3 stoplights are red:\n- Base time: 10 minutes\n- Additional time: 3 minutes \u00d7 3 red lights = 9 minutes\n- Total time for first route: 10 + 9 = 19 minutes\n\nThe second route takes: 14 minutes\n\nDifference: 19 - 14 = 5 minutes longer\n\n**Note:** The partial solution provided has an arithmetic error.
