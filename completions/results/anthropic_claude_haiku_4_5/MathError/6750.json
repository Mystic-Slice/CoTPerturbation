{"id": 6750, "question": "A Moroccan restaurant received 3 different shipments of couscous. The first two shipments of 7 and 13 pounds arrived on the same day. The next day's shipment was 45 pounds of couscous. If it takes 5 pounds of couscous to make a dish, how many dishes did the restaurant make?", "solution": "The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = <<7+13=20>>20 pounds\nAdding that weight to the next day\u2019s shipment results in a total weight of 20 + 45 = <<20+45=65>>65 pounds\nSince each dish takes 5 pounds, then the restaurant makes 65/5 = <<65/5=13>>13 dishes\n#### 13", "clean_solution": "The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = 20 pounds\nAdding that weight to the next day\u2019s shipment results in a total weight of 20 + 45 = 65 pounds\nSince each dish takes 5 pounds, then the restaurant makes 65/5 = 13 dishes", "perturbed_solution": "The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = 20 pounds\nAdding that weight to the next day\u2019s shipment results in a total weight of 20 + 45 = 65 pounds\nSince each dish takes 5 pounds, then the restaurant makes 65/5 = 56 dishes", "answer": 13.0, "perturbed_answer": 56.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll verify and complete the solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- First shipment: 7 pounds\n- Second shipment: 13 pounds\n- Third shipment: 45 pounds\n- Couscous needed per dish: 5 pounds\n\n**Solution verification:**\n\nStep 1: Add the first two shipments\n7 + 13 = 20 pounds \u2713\n\nStep 2: Add the third shipment\n20 + 45 = 65 pounds \u2713\n\nStep 3: Calculate number of dishes\n65 \u00f7 5 = 13 dishes \u2713\n\nThe solution is complete and correct.
