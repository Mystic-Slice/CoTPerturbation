{"id": 2540, "question": "Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years. How much money will the art piece have increased by?", "solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $<<12000-4000=8000>>8000\n#### 8000", "clean_solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $8000", "perturbed_solution": "If the art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price, it will be worth 3*$4000 = $12000 in another three years.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000-$4000 = $8601", "answer": 8000.0, "perturbed_answer": 8601.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll analyze the partial solution and verify if it's correct.\n\nGiven information:\n- Rosie purchased the art piece 3 years ago for $4000\n- In another 3 years (6 years from now, or 3 years from the purchase date), it will be worth 3 times the buying price\n\nThe partial solution states:\n- Future value = 3 \u00d7 $4000 = $12000\n- Increase = $12000 - $4000 = $8000\n\nLet me verify this logic:\n- Purchase price (3 years ago): $4000\n- Price in another 3 years: 3 \u00d7 $4000 = $12000\n- Total increase from purchase price to future price: $12000 - $4000 = $8000\n\nThe solution is correct.
