{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=14 minutes to complete the race.", "answer": 10.0, "perturbed_answer": 14.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- First snail's speed: 2 feet per minute\n- Second snail's speed: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 feet per minute\n- Third snail's speed: 5 \u00d7 (second snail's speed) = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 feet per minute\n- First snail's time: 20 minutes\n\n**From the partial solution:**\n- Second snail's time: 20/2 = 10 minutes\n\n**Finding the distance:**\nDistance = First snail's speed \u00d7 First snail's time\nDistance = 2 feet/minute \u00d7 20 minutes = 40 feet\n\n**Finding the third snail's time:**\nThe third snail travels at 20 feet per minute.\nTime = Distance \u00f7 Speed\nTime = 40 feet \u00f7 20 feet/minute = 2 minutes\n\nAlternatively, we can use the relationship that time is inversely proportional to speed:\n- Third snail's speed is 5 times the second snail's speed\n- Therefore, third snail's time = Second snail's time \u00f7 5 = 10 \u00f7 5 = 2 minutes\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- First snail's speed: 2 feet per minute\n- Second snail's speed: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 feet per minute\n- Third snail's speed: 5 \u00d7 (second snail's speed) = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 feet per minute\n- First snail's time: 20 minutes\n\n**Finding the distance:**\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance = 2 feet/minute \u00d7 20 minutes = 40 feet\n\n**Finding the third snail's time:**\nThe partial solution correctly found that the second snail takes 10 minutes (not 14 as stated - let me verify: if speed doubles, time is halved, so 20/2 = 10 minutes).\n\nFor the third snail:\n- Speed of third snail: 20 feet per minute\n- Distance: 40 feet\n- Time = Distance \u00f7 Speed\n- Time = 40 \u00f7 20 = 2 minutes\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
