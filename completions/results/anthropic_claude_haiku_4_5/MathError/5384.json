{"id": 5384, "question": "An apple tree produced 200 apples in a particular season. The tree made 20% fewer fruits the following season, but the tree fruits production in the second season doubled during the third season. Calculate the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons.", "solution": "If the tree produced 200 apples in the first season, there were 20/100*200 = 40 fewer fruits in the second season.\nThe total production from the apple tree in the second season is 200-40 = <<200-40=160>>160\nIn the two seasons, the apple tree produced 160+200 = <<160+200=360>>360 fruits.\nThe apple tree doubled the number of fruits it produced in the third season, totaling 160*2 = <<160*2=320>>320.\nIn the three seasons, the apple tree produced 320+360 = <<320+360=680>>680 apples.\n#### 680", "clean_solution": "If the tree produced 200 apples in the first season, there were 20/100*200 = 40 fewer fruits in the second season.\nThe total production from the apple tree in the second season is 200-40 = 160\nIn the two seasons, the apple tree produced 160+200 = 360 fruits.", "perturbed_solution": "If the tree produced 200 apples in the first season, there were 20/100*200 = 40 fewer fruits in the second season.\nThe total production from the apple tree in the second season is 200-40 = 160\nIn the two seasons, the apple tree produced 160+200 = 661 fruits.", "answer": 360.0, "perturbed_answer": 661.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- First season: 200 apples\n- Second season: 20% fewer than first season = 160 apples (as calculated)\n- Third season: Double the second season production\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nThe partial solution correctly calculated:\n- First season: 200 apples\n- Second season: 160 apples\n- Total for first two seasons: 360 apples\n\nNow I need to find the third season production:\n- Third season production = 2 \u00d7 (second season production)\n- Third season production = 2 \u00d7 160 = 320 apples\n\n**Total production for all three seasons:**\nTotal = First season + Second season + Third season\nTotal = 200 + 160 + 320\nTotal = 680 apples\n\n#### 680", "answer_solution_clean": "680", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Season 1: 200 apples\n- Season 2: 20% fewer than Season 1 = 160 apples (as calculated)\n- Season 3: Double the production of Season 2\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nThe partial solution correctly calculated:\n- Season 1: 200 apples\n- Season 2: 160 apples\n- Total for first two seasons: 360 apples (note: the partial solution shows 661, which appears to be a typo; 200 + 160 = 360)\n\n**For Season 3:**\nThe tree's production doubled during the third season compared to the second season.\nSeason 3 = 2 \u00d7 Season 2\nSeason 3 = 2 \u00d7 160 = 320 apples\n\n**Total production for all three seasons:**\nTotal = Season 1 + Season 2 + Season 3\nTotal = 200 + 160 + 320\nTotal = 680 apples\n\n#### 680", "answer_solution_perturbed": "680"}
