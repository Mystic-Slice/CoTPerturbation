{"id": 997, "question": "Ittymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?", "solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.\nIf they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=12 fish.", "perturbed_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=89 fish.", "answer": 12.0, "perturbed_answer": 89.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to continue from the partial solution to find how many fish each person gets to eat.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Total eyes = 24\n- Total fish = 12\n\nNow, let me work through what happens:\n\n1. The 12 fish are split equally among the three of them (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck)\n   - Each gets: 12/3 = 4 fish\n\n2. However, after the split, they give all the eyes to Oomyapeck\n   - Oomyapeck gets all 24 eyes from his 4 fish plus the eyes from the other 8 fish\n   - Wait, let me reconsider. Each fish has 2 eyes, so 12 fish have 24 eyes total.\n\n3. The eyes are distributed as follows:\n   - Oomyapeck gets all 24 eyes\n   - From these 24 eyes: the dog eats 2 eyes, and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes\n   - This checks out: 2 + 22 = 24 \u2713\n\n4. Now for the fish distribution:\n   - Initially, each of the three gets 4 fish\n   - But then all eyes go to Oomyapeck\n   - The question asks how many fish each will be given to eat\n\nSince the eyes are removed from the fish before eating (they give the eyes to Oomyapeck), the fish themselves are still distributed equally:\n- Ittymangnark gets: 4 fish\n- Kingnook gets: 4 fish  \n- Oomyapeck gets: 4 fish (plus he also gets to eat 22 eyes from all the fish)\n\nEach of them is given 4 fish to eat.\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to continue from the partial solution and find how many fish each person gets to eat.\n\nFrom the partial solution:\n- Total eyes = 24\n- Total fish = 24/2 = 12 fish (note: the partial solution says 89, but 24/2 = 12, so there's an error there)\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes\n- The dog eats 2 eyes\n- Total eyes = 22 + 2 = 24 eyes\n- Since each fish has 2 eyes: 24/2 = 12 fish total\n\nNow, the fish are split equally among three people: Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck.\n\nFish per person = 12/3 = 4 fish each\n\nHowever, we need to account for what Oomyapeck actually eats:\n- Oomyapeck receives 4 fish (his equal share)\n- But he gives the eyes to the dog (2 eyes) and eats 22 eyes himself\n- This means Oomyapeck eats the eyes from his fish, but the rest of the fish (the body) he keeps\n\nSince the question asks \"how many fish will each of them be given to eat\":\n- Ittymangnark is given 4 fish to eat\n- Kingnook is given 4 fish to eat\n- Oomyapeck is given 4 fish to eat\n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
