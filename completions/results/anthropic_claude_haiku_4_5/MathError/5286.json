However, let me reconsider the problem.\n\nThe problem asks: \"Using all the flowers, how many bouquets containing 5 flowers each can he make?\"\n\nThe total number of flowers is:\n75 + 90 = 165 flowers\n\nIf each bouquet contains 5 flowers:\n165 \u00f7 5 = 33 bouquets\n\nThis makes sense because we're using ALL the flowers to make bouquets of 5 flowers each, not necessarily keeping narcissus and chrysanthemums separate.\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
