{"id": 5368, "question": "Lisa is making a pizza. She uses 30 pieces of pepperoni for a pizza, twice as many pieces of ham, and 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni.

Ham: 30 \u00d7 2 = 60 pieces \u2713\n2. Sausage: 30 + 12 = 42 pieces \u2713\n3. Total meat: 30 + 60 + 42 = 132 pieces\n\nNow distributing evenly across 6 slices:\n- Pepperoni per slice: 30 \u00f7 6 = 5 pieces \u2713\n- Ham per slice: 60 \u00f7 6 = 10 pieces \u2713\n- Sausage per slice: 42 \u00f7 6 = 7 pieces \u2713\n\nTotal meat per slice: 5 + 10 + 7 = 22 pieces\n\nThe partial solution contains an error in the final calculation. The correct answer is 22 pieces of meat altogether on each slice, not 72.\n\n#### 22", "answer_solution_perturbed": "22"}
