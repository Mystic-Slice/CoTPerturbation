{"id": 2226, "question": "Every week of last month Paul tried out a new cake recipe.  The first week, he followed a cake recipe that called for 24 cups of sugar. Each week after that, he reduced the amount of sugar by half. How much sugar did he use for the cake on the fourth week?", "solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = <<24/2=12>>12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups\nThe fourth week, he used 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cups\n#### 3", "clean_solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = 6 cups", "perturbed_solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = 9 cups", "answer": 6.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution Summary:**\n- Week 1: 24 cups of sugar\n- Week 2: 24/2 = 12 cups of sugar\n- Week 3: 12/2 = 6 cups of sugar\n\n**Continuing to Week 4:**\n\nOn the fourth week, Paul reduced the amount of sugar by half again from week 3.\n\nWeek 4: 6/2 = 3 cups of sugar\n\n#### 3", "answer_solution_clean": "3", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to continue from the partial solution provided.\n\nGiven information:\n- Week 1: 24 cups of sugar\n- Week 2: 24/2 = 12 cups\n- Week 3: 12/2 = 6 cups (Note: The partial solution says 9 cups, but this appears to be an error.
