{"id": 5921, "question": "Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?", "solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.\nAt 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.\nAdding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.\nSince each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars\n#### 10", "clean_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 225 cents.", "perturbed_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 344 cents.", "answer": 225.0, "perturbed_answer": 344.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Call to dad (local): 45 minutes at 5 cents/minute\n- Call to brother (international): 31 minutes at 25 cents/minute\n\n**Partial solution completed:**\n- Cost of calling dad: 5 \u00d7 45 = 225 cents\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nCost of calling brother (international call):\n- 25 cents/minute \u00d7 31 minutes = 775 cents\n\nTotal cost in cents:\n- 225 cents + 775 cents = 1000 cents\n\nConvert to dollars:\n- 1000 cents \u00f7 100 = 10 dollars\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_clean": "10", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Call to dad (local): 45 minutes at 5 cents/minute\n- Call to brother (international): 31 minutes at 25 cents/minute\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nThe partial solution states: Local call cost = 5 \u00d7 45 = 225 cents (note: the partial solution shows 344, which appears to be an error; 5 \u00d7 45 = 225)\n\nNow for the international call:\n- International call cost = 25 \u00d7 31 = 775 cents\n\n**Total cost:**\n- Total in cents = 225 + 775 = 1000 cents\n\n**Convert to dollars:**\n- Total in dollars = 1000 \u00f7 100 = 10 dollars\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10"}
