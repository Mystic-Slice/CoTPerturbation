{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $44 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.", "answer": 30.0, "perturbed_answer": 44.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll verify and complete the solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Total flour: 6 pounds\n- Flour for cakes: 4 pounds (0.5 pounds per cake)\n- Flour for cupcakes: 2 pounds (1/5 pounds per cupcake)\n- Price per cake: $2.5\n- Price per cupcake: $1\n\n**Verification of partial solution:**\n\nNumber of cakes:\n- 4 \u00f7 0.5 = 8 cakes \u2713\n\nNumber of cupcakes:\n- 2 \u00f7 (1/5) = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 cupcakes \u2713\n\nEarnings from cakes:\n- 8 \u00d7 $2.5 = $20 \u2713\n\nEarnings from cupcakes:\n- 10 \u00d7 $1 = $10 \u2713\n\nTotal earnings:\n- $20 + $10 = $30 \u2713\n\nThe partial solution is complete and correct.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll verify and complete the solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Total flour: 6 pounds\n- Flour for cakes: 4 pounds (0.5 pounds per cake)\n- Flour for cupcakes: 2 pounds (1/5 pounds per cupcake)\n- Price per cake: $2.5\n- Price per cupcake: $1\n\n**Verification of partial solution:**\n\nNumber of cakes:\n4 \u00f7 0.5 = 8 cakes \u2713\n\nNumber of cupcakes:\n2 \u00f7 (1/5) = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 cupcakes \u2713\n\nEarnings from cakes:\n$2.5 \u00d7 8 = $20 \u2713\n\nEarnings from cupcakes:\n$1 \u00d7 10 = $10 \u2713\n\nTotal earnings:\n$20 + $10 = $30\n\n**Note:** There appears to be an error in the partial solution.
