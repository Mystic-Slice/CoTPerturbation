{"id": 5863, "question": "Mary is making a spinach quiche. She takes 40 ounces of raw spinach and cooks it until it's 20% of its initial volume. If she mixes the spinach with 6 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of eggs, what is the total volume of the quiche?", "solution": "First find the cooked volume of the spinach: 40 ounces * 20% = <<40*20*.01=8>>8 ounces\nThen add that to the volume of the other ingredients to find the total volume: 8 ounces + 6 ounces + 4 ounces = <<8+6+4=18>>18 ounces\n#### 18", "clean_solution": "First find the cooked volume of the spinach: 40 ounces * 20% = 8 ounces", "perturbed_solution": "First find the cooked volume of the spinach: 40 ounces * 20% = 7 ounces", "answer": 8.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution Given:**\n- Cooked spinach volume: 40 ounces \u00d7 20% = 8 ounces\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nNow I need to find the total volume of the quiche by adding all the ingredients:\n\n- Cooked spinach: 8 ounces\n- Cream cheese: 6 ounces\n- Eggs: 4 ounces\n\nTotal volume of quiche = 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 ounces\n\n#### 18", "answer_solution_clean": "18", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Raw spinach: 40 ounces\n- Cooked spinach volume: 40 \u00d7 20% = 8 ounces (Note: The partial solution shows 7 ounces, but 40 \u00d7 0.20 = 8 ounces)\n- Cream cheese: 6 ounces\n- Eggs: 4 ounces\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nThe total volume of the quiche is the sum of all ingredients:\n- Cooked spinach: 8 ounces\n- Cream cheese: 6 ounces\n- Eggs: 4 ounces\n\nTotal volume = 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 ounces\n\n#### 18", "answer_solution_perturbed": "18"}
