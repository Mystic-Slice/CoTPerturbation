{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 15 people.", "answer": 36.0, "perturbed_answer": 15.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I need to continue from the partial solution and account for the repeated players.\n\n**Partial Solution Analysis:**\n- Mona joined 9 groups with 4 other players each\n- Total player instances: 9 \u00d7 4 = 36 player slots\n\n**Accounting for Repeats:**\nNow I need to subtract the players who appeared more than once:\n\n1. One group included two players she had grouped with before that weekend\n   - These 2 players appear twice in the count (once in their original group, once in this new group)\n   - Overcounting: 2 players counted twice = 2 extra counts\n\n2. Another group included one person she had grouped with before\n   - This 1 player appears twice in the count (once in their original group, once in this new group)\n   - Overcounting: 1 player counted twice = 1 extra count\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Total player instances: 36\n- Subtract the overcounts: 36 - 2 - 1 = 33\n\nTherefore, the number of unique players Mona grouped with that weekend is 33.\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_clean": "33", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution carefully, considering the overlaps mentioned in the problem.\n\nLet me work through this step-by-step:\n\n**Given information:**\n- Mona joined 9 groups\n- Each group has 4 other players (besides Mona)\n- One group included 2 players she had grouped with before that weekend\n- Another group included 1 player she had grouped with before that weekend\n\n**Partial solution analysis:**\nThe partial solution states: 9 groups \u00d7 4 players per group = 36 people total (not 15 as written - that appears to be an error in the partial solution)\n\n**Correcting the approach:**\n\nIf we simply multiply 9 groups \u00d7 4 players = 36 total player slots across all groups.\n\nHowever, we need to account for the repeats:\n- One group had 2 players that were repeats (players she had already grouped with in a previous weekend)\n- Another group had 1 player that was a repeat (a player she had already grouped with in a previous weekend)\n\nThe question asks for unique players **that weekend** - so we need to count how many different players she played with during those 9 groups.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Total player slots: 9 groups \u00d7 4 players = 36 slots\n- Repeats within that weekend: \n  - One group had 2 repeats from before (these don't count as new unique players from that weekend)\n  - Another group had 1 repeat from before (this doesn't count as a new unique player from that weekend)\n  \nWait, I need to reconsider. The repeats are from \"before that weekend\" - meaning they were players from previous weekends. So within the 9 groups that weekend:\n- 2 players appeared in one group (and had played with her before)\n- 1 player appeared in another group (and had played with her before)\n\nThese 3 player instances are repeats, so:\n- Unique players = 36 - 3 = 33\n\nActually, let me reconsider once more. If 2 players were in one group and 1 player was in another group, and these are the same players appearing again, then we subtract the duplicate counts:\n- Total slots: 36\n- Subtract the 2 repeats in one group: -2\n- Subtract the 1 repeat in another group: -1\n- Unique players: 36 - 2 - 1 = 33\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
