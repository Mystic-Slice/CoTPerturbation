{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = 55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = 27 hours on math tutoring for the first two months", "answer": 55.0, "perturbed_answer": 27.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll verify and complete the solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Sam earns $10 per hour\n- First month earnings: $200\n- Second month earnings: $150 more than first month\n\n**Solution verification:**\n\nStep 1: Calculate second month earnings\n- Second month = $200 + $150 = $350 \u2713\n\nStep 2: Calculate total earnings for two months\n- Total = $200 + $350 = $550 \u2713\n\nStep 3: Calculate total hours spent\n- Hours = Total earnings \u00f7 Hourly rate\n- Hours = $550 \u00f7 $10 = 55 hours \u2713\n\nThe solution is complete and correct.\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll verify and complete this solution.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Sam earns $10 per hour\n- First month: $200\n- Second month: $150 more than first month\n\n**Solution verification:**\n\nStep 1: Calculate second month earnings\n- Second month = $200 + $150 = $350 \u2713\n\nStep 2: Calculate total earnings for two months\n- Total = $200 + $350 = $550 \u2713\n\nStep 3: Calculate total hours spent\n- Hours = Total earnings \u00f7 Hourly rate\n- Hours = $550 \u00f7 $10 = 55 hours\n\nWait, let me recalculate: $550 \u00f7 $10 = 55 hours (not 27 hours as stated in the partial solution)\n\nThe partial solution contains an arithmetic error.
