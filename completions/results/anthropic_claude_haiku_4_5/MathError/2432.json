Gave half of 20 to faculty: 20/2 = 10 brownies given away\n   - Remaining: 20 - 10 = 10 brownies\n\n2. Gave half of remaining 10 to Carl: 10/2 = 5 brownies given away\n   - Remaining: 10 - 5 = 5 brownies\n\n3. Gave 2 to Simon: 2 brownies given away\n   - Remaining: 5 - 2 = 3 brownies\n\n**Verification:**\n- Started: 20\n- After faculty: 20 - 10 = 10\n- After Carl: 10 - 5 = 5\n- After Simon: 5 - 2 = 3 \u2713\n\nThe solution is complete and correct.
