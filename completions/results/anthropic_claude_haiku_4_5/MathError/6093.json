{"id": 6093, "question": "During my workout yesterday, I did 30 squats. Each day, I plan to increase my number of squats by 5 more than the previous day.

Let me first clarify the timeline and correct the partial solution.\n\n**Day 1 (Yesterday):** 30 squats\n**Day 2 (Today):** 30 + 5 = 35 squats\n**Day 3 (Tomorrow):** 35 + 5 = 40 squats\n**Day 4 (Day after tomorrow):** 40 + 5 = 45 squats\n\nNote: The partial solution appears to have an error (76 squats doesn't follow the pattern). The correct calculation is:\n- Day 1: 30 squats\n- Day 2: 30 + 5 = 35 squats\n- Day 3: 35 + 5 = 40 squats\n- Day 4: 40 + 5 = 45 squats\n\nThe day after tomorrow is Day 4, so I will perform **45 squats**.\n\n#### 45", "answer_solution_perturbed": "45"}
