{"id": 101, "question": "Marcy is a makeup artist and has agreed to do some makeup for her friend's wedding. The only makeup she has limited stock of is lip gloss so she counts how many tubes she needs. Each tube of lip gloss will hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. Marcy decides to bring 6 tubs of lip gloss, each of which holds 2 tubes of lip gloss, and this will be the exact amount she needs for everyone's makeup. How many people is Marcy painting with makeup?", "solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = <<6*2=12>>12 tubes of lip gloss.\nSo she must be applying makeup to 12 tubes of lip gloss * 3 people per tube of lip gloss = <<12*3=36>>36 people.\n#### 36", "clean_solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = 12 tubes of lip gloss.", "perturbed_solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = 50 tubes of lip gloss.", "answer": 12.0, "perturbed_answer": 50.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution:**\nMarcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss \u00d7 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub = 12 tubes of lip gloss.\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nNow I need to find how many people can be painted with 12 tubes of lip gloss.\n\nGiven information:\n- Each tube of lip gloss holds enough for 3 people's makeup\n- Marcy has 12 tubes of lip gloss total\n\nNumber of people = 12 tubes \u00d7 3 people per tube = 36 people\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_clean": "36", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution and find how many people Marcy is painting with makeup.\n\n**Continuing from the partial solution:**\n\nThe partial solution states: Marcy is bringing 6 tubs \u00d7 2 tubes per tub = 12 tubes of lip gloss.\n\n(Note: The partial solution says 50, but 6 \u00d7 2 = 12, so I'll use the correct calculation)\n\n**Now I need to find the number of people:**\n\nWe know that:\n- Each tube of lip gloss holds enough for 3 people's makeup\n- Marcy has 12 tubes of lip gloss total\n\nNumber of people = 12 tubes \u00d7 3 people per tube = 36 people\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_perturbed": "36"}
