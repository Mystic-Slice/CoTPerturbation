{"id": 230, "question": "Emery and Serena go to their school library, and each borrows a copy of The life of Jack Steve's book to read for their school project. If Emery can read five times as fast as Serena, and the book takes her 20 days to read, what's the average number of days the two take to read the book?", "solution": "If Emery took twenty days to read the book, then it took Serena 5*20 = <<20*5=100>>100 days to read the whole book.\nThe total number of days taken by the two to read the book is 100+20 = <<100+20=120>>120 days.\nThe average number of days the two take to read the book is 120/2 = <<120/2=60>>60 days.\n#### 60", "clean_solution": "If Emery took twenty days to read the book, then it took Serena 5*20 = 100 days to read the whole book.", "perturbed_solution": "If Emery took twenty days to read the book, then it took Serena 5*20 = 6 days to read the whole book.", "answer": 100.0, "perturbed_answer": 6.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Emery took 20 days to read the book\n- Serena took 5 \u00d7 20 = 100 days to read the book (from partial solution)\n\n**Finding the average:**\nThe average number of days the two take to read the book is:\n\nAverage = (Emery's days + Serena's days) / 2\nAverage = (20 + 100) / 2\nAverage = 120 / 2\nAverage = 60\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_clean": "60", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution and find the average number of days the two take to read the book.\n\nLet me check the partial solution first:\n- The problem states Emery can read five times as fast as Serena\n- Emery takes 20 days to read the book\n- If Emery reads 5 times as fast, then Serena takes 5 times as long\n- So Serena takes 5 \u00d7 20 = 100 days (not 6 days as stated in the partial solution)\n\nThe partial solution has an error. Let me correct it:\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n- Emery's reading time: 20 days\n- Since Emery reads 5 times as fast as Serena, Serena takes 5 times as long\n- Serena's reading time: 5 \u00d7 20 = 100 days\n\n**Finding the average:**\nAverage = (Emery's time + Serena's time) / 2\nAverage = (20 + 100) / 2\nAverage = 120 / 2\nAverage = 60 days\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_perturbed": "60"}
