The problem says Crabby has to eat \"at least twice as many\" oysters as Squido. This means Crabby eats \u2265 2 \u00d7 Squido's amount.\n\nThe minimum amount Crabby would eat is exactly twice what Squido eats:\n- Crabby eats: 2 \u00d7 200 = 400 oysters\n\n**Total oysters eaten together:**\n- Squido: 200 oysters\n- Crabby: 400 oysters\n- Total: 200 + 400 = 600 oysters\n\nThe partial solution is correct.
