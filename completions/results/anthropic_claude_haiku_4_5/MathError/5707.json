{"id": 5707, "question": "Max has a collection of stamps in three colors: 20 red stamps, 80 blue stamps and 7 yellow ones. He is trying to sell the whole collection. He already sold 20 red stamps for the price of $1.1 for each stamp and 80 blue stamps for the price of $0.8 for each stamp. What price did he need to set for each yellow stamp to be able to earn the total of $100 from the whole sale?", "solution": "Max earned 20 * 1.1 = $<<20*1.1=22>>22 on red stamps.\nFrom the blue stamps Max got 80 * 0.8 = $<<80*0.8=64>>64.\nHis earnings so far are 22 + 64 = $<<22+64=86>>86.\nTo earn $100 he needs 100 \u2013 86 = $<<100-86=14>>14 more.\nMax has 7 yellow stamps, so he needs to set the price at 14 / 7 = $<<14/7=2>>2.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "Max earned 20 * 1.1 = $22 on red stamps.", "perturbed_solution": "Max earned 20 * 1.1 = $47 on red stamps.", "answer": 22.0, "perturbed_answer": 47.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Red stamps: 20 stamps sold at $1.1 each\n- Blue stamps: 80 stamps sold at $0.8 each\n- Yellow stamps: 7 stamps at unknown price\n- Total target earnings: $100\n\n**Partial solution given:**\nMax earned 20 \u00d7 1.1 = $22 on red stamps.\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nStep 1: Calculate earnings from blue stamps.\nBlue stamps earnings = 80 \u00d7 0.8 = $64\n\nStep 2: Calculate total earnings from red and blue stamps.\nTotal from red and blue = $22 + $64 = $86\n\nStep 3: Calculate how much more is needed from yellow stamps.\nAmount needed from yellow stamps = $100 - $86 = $14\n\nStep 4: Calculate the price per yellow stamp.\nPrice per yellow stamp = $14 \u00f7 7 = $2\n\n**Verification:**\n- Red: 20 \u00d7 $1.1 = $22\n- Blue: 80 \u00d7 $0.8 = $64\n- Yellow: 7 \u00d7 $2 = $14\n- Total: $22 + $64 + $14 = $100 \u2713\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Red stamps sold: 20 at $1.1 each = $22 (Note: The partial solution says $47, but 20 \u00d7 1.1 = $22, so I'll use the correct calculation)\n- Blue stamps sold: 80 at $0.8 each\n- Yellow stamps: 7 (price unknown)\n- Target total earnings: $100\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nEarnings from red stamps: 20 \u00d7 $1.1 = $22\n\nEarnings from blue stamps: 80 \u00d7 $0.8 = $64\n\nTotal earned so far: $22 + $64 = $86\n\nRemaining amount needed: $100 - $86 = $14\n\nNumber of yellow stamps: 7\n\nPrice per yellow stamp: $14 \u00f7 7 = $2\n\n**Verification:**\n- Red: 20 \u00d7 $1.1 = $22\n- Blue: 80 \u00d7 $0.8 = $64\n- Yellow: 7 \u00d7 $2 = $14\n- Total: $22 + $64 + $14 = $100 \u2713\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
