{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = 36.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = 81.", "answer": 36.0, "perturbed_answer": 81.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution Summary:**\n- Current usage per year: 90 \u00d7 2 = 180 kilograms\n- Increase needed: 180 \u00d7 0.20 = 36 kilograms\n\n**Completing the solution:**\n\nTo find the total amount of grapes needed after the 20% increase:\n\nTotal grapes needed = Current yearly usage + Increase\nTotal grapes needed = 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\nGiven information:\n- Current usage: 90 kg every 6 months\n- Partial solution shows: 180 kg per year currently, and 36 kg increase needed\n\nLet me complete the solution:\n\nCurrent annual usage: 180 kilograms per year\n\nIncrease needed: 180 \u00d7 0.20 = 36 kilograms per year\n\nTotal grapes needed after increasing production by 20%:\n180 + 36 = 216 kilograms per year\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
