{"id": 1034, "question": "When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?", "solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times her ratio.\nThus, she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 cups of cream cheese.\nShe uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for 2 cups of cream cheese, so she used 8 / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla.\nFor each teaspoon of vanilla, she uses 2 eggs, so she used 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 eggs.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 2 times her ratio.", "perturbed_solution": "Betty used 2 cups of sugar in her cheesecake, so she used 2 * 1 = 10 times her ratio.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 10.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Sugar to cream cheese ratio: 1 part sugar : 4 parts cream cheese\n- Vanilla to cream cheese: 1 teaspoon vanilla per 2 cups cream cheese\n- Eggs to vanilla: 2 eggs per 1 teaspoon vanilla\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nFrom the partial solution: Betty used 2 cups of sugar, which is 2 times the base ratio unit.\n\n**Step 1: Find the amount of cream cheese**\n- If sugar : cream cheese = 1 : 4\n- And Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n- Then cream cheese = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese\n\n**Step 2: Find the amount of vanilla**\n- Vanilla ratio: 1 teaspoon vanilla per 2 cups cream cheese\n- Betty used 8 cups of cream cheese\n- Vanilla needed = 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla\n\n**Step 3: Find the number of eggs**\n- Eggs ratio: 2 eggs per 1 teaspoon vanilla\n- Betty used 4 teaspoons of vanilla\n- Eggs needed = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 eggs\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to complete this solution step by step.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Sugar to cream cheese ratio: 1 part sugar : 4 parts cream cheese\n- Vanilla to cream cheese: 1 teaspoon vanilla per 2 cups cream cheese\n- Eggs to vanilla: 2 eggs per 1 teaspoon vanilla\n- Betty used 2 cups of sugar\n\n**Continuing from the partial solution:**\n\nThe partial solution states Betty used 2 cups of sugar, so she used 2 * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese (not 10 times as written - that appears to be an error in the partial solution).\n\nLet me work through this correctly:\n\n**Step 1: Find cream cheese amount**\n- Ratio is 1 part sugar : 4 parts cream cheese\n- Sugar used = 2 cups\n- Cream cheese used = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 cups\n\n**Step 2: Find vanilla amount**\n- Ratio is 1 teaspoon vanilla per 2 cups cream cheese\n- Cream cheese used = 8 cups\n- Vanilla used = 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 teaspoons\n\n**Step 3: Find eggs amount**\n- Ratio is 2 eggs per 1 teaspoon vanilla\n- Vanilla used = 4 teaspoons\n- Eggs used = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 eggs\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
