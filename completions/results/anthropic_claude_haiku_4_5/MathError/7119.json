{"id": 7119, "question": "Jerry was asked by her mom to do grocery shopping. He needs to buy 2 liters of mustard oil that costs $13 per liter, 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta that costs $4 per pound, and 1  pound of pasta sauce that costs $5. If Jerry can keep the rest of the $50 after grocery shopping, how much money will he have?", "solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $<<13*2=26>>26.\nThe cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nSo, Jerry spent a total of $26 + $12 + $5 = $<<26+12+5=43>>43 for grocery shopping.\nThus, Jerry will have $50 - $43 = $<<50-43=7>>7 for himself.\n#### 7", "clean_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $26.", "perturbed_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $98.", "answer": 26.0, "perturbed_answer": 98.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5", "completed_solution_clean": "I'll continue from the partial solution provided.\n\n**Partial Solution Given:**\nThe cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 \u00d7 2 = $26.\n\n**Continuing the solution:**\n\nCost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta:\n$4 \u00d7 3 = $12\n\nCost of 1 pound of pasta sauce:\n$5 \u00d7 1 = $5\n\n**Total cost of groceries:**\n$26 + $12 + $5 = $43\n\n**Money Jerry will have left:**\n$50 - $43 = $7\n\n#### 7", "answer_solution_clean": "7", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to continue from the partial solution and complete the problem.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Starting money: $50\n- 2 liters of mustard oil at $13 per liter\n- 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta at $4 per pound\n- 1 pound of pasta sauce at $5 per pound\n\n**Partial solution states:**\n- Cost of mustard oil = $13 \u00d7 2 = $26 (Note: The partial solution says $98, but this appears to be an error.
