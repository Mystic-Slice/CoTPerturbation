If \"56 sheep and goats\" means the combined total of sheep and goats is 56, then:\n- Cows = 40\n- Sheep and Goats = 56\n- Total = 40 + 56 = 96\n\nThis means there are 200 - 96 = 104 other animals, which would be goats only if the problem means something different.\n\nActually, re-reading: \"56 sheep and goats\" most likely means 56 total for both sheep and goats combined. The problem asks specifically for goats, but doesn't give us the breakdown between sheep and goats within that 56.\n\nHowever, following the partial solution's logic: if we assume all 56 are accounted for in the \"sheep and goats\" category, and we need to find just goats, the problem statement seems incomplete unless \"56 sheep and goats\" means something specific.\n\nBut based on the partial solution provided, which calculates 200 - 96 = 104, the answer given is:\n\n#### 104", "answer_solution_clean": "104", "completed_solution_perturbed": "I need to analyze this partial solution to see if it's correct.\n\nGiven information:\n- Total animals: 200\n- Cows: 40\n- Sheep and goats combined: 56\n\nThe partial solution states:\n- 56 + 40 = 96 animals other than goats\n- 200 - 96 = 104 goats\n\nLet me verify this logic:\n- If there are 40 cows and 56 sheep and goats combined\n- Then the animals that are NOT goats would be: 40 cows + (sheep from the 56)\n- But wait, the 56 includes both sheep AND goats\n\nLet me reconsider the problem statement: \"56 sheep and goats\" means sheep + goats = 56\n\nSo:\n- Cows: 40\n- Sheep and goats combined: 56\n- Total: 200\n\nThe number of goats = Total - Cows - Sheep\nBut we don't know how many sheep there are separately.\n\nActually, looking at the partial solution again: it says \"56 + 40 = 96 animals other than goats\"\n\nThis interpretation means:\n- 40 cows (not goats)\n- 56 sheep (not goats)\n- Total non-goats: 40 + 56 = 96\n\nTherefore: Goats = 200 - 96 = 104\n\nThe partial solution has an arithmetic error.
