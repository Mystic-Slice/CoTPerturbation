Similarly, G9\u2019s 1 repeat must be from G1\u2013G8.  \n\nBut this arrangement means only 2 groups have repeats, all others are all new. That fits the problem statement.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check total appearances vs unique count**  \nTotal appearances = 36.  \nRepeats within weekend:  \n- G8: 2 repeats (so those 2 players counted already earlier)  \n- G9: 1 repeat (so that player counted already earlier)  \n\nTotal repeats = 3.  \n\nUnique players = total appearances \u2212 repeats = \\( 36 - 3 = 33 \\).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Verify consistency**  \nCould the repeats overlap?  \nThe problem says \u201cone group included two players she had grouped with before that weekend\u201d \u2014 means those two are repeats from earlier groups that weekend.  \n\u201cAnother group included one person she had grouped with before\u201d \u2014 means that one is a repeat from earlier groups that weekend.  \n\nNo indication that these repeats are the same person across the two repeat groups, so they are distinct repeats unless coincidence. But since we\u2019re minimizing unique players? Actually, we\u2019re not minimizing, we\u2019re counting actual unique players given the constraints.  \n\nIf repeats are distinct players, then indeed:  \nRepeats = 3 separate repeat appearances of already-counted players.  \n\nSo unique players = \\( 36 - 3 = 33 \\).  \n\n---\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_clean": "33", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s go step-by-step.\n\nMona joins **9 groups** with **4 other players** each time.  \nSo she sees \\( 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\) **player appearances** in total over the weekend.\n\nNow, in these appearances:\n- One group had **2** players she\u2019d grouped with before the weekend (those 2 are repeats from *earlier weekends*, not repeats *within this weekend* \u2014 but since we are counting unique players **this weekend**, repeats within the weekend matter).\n- Another group had **1** player she\u2019d grouped with before the weekend.\n\nImportant: \u201cBefore that weekend\u201d means before this weekend \u2014 these players are *not* repeats from within the weekend yet, but they could appear again during this weekend? Wait, the problem doesn\u2019t say they repeated during the weekend, so they count as separate unique players in this weekend if they only appear once in this weekend, but we need to consider: Did the \u201c2 players\u201d in one group include one player who also appears in the \u201c1 player\u201d case? Probably not specified. But we can\u2019t assume they are different earlier-weekend players unless told.\n\nActually, re-reading: The problem says: **One group included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before.**  \nSo in group A, 2 repeat players from earlier weekends; in group B, 1 repeat player from earlier weekends. No mention of these 3 being the same or different, but since they\u2019re in different groups, they could be different people (unless the problem hints they\u2019re the same). It doesn\u2019t specify they are different, but it doesn\u2019t say \u201cone of those two\u201d in group B, so probably distinct.\n\nSo among the 36 appearances:\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- Total appearances = 36  \n- Repeat appearances **within the weekend** (same player in multiple groups this weekend) = unknown.\n\nWe need: **unique players Mona grouped with on the video game that weekend.**\n\nWe only know that among all players this weekend, 3 of them (the ones from earlier weekends) were not new to her lifetime, but we still count them as unique players this weekend if they appear this weekend \u2014 they are included in the count. The question: Did any player appear in more than one group during this weekend? It doesn\u2019t say, so maybe each player only appeared once. But if so, unique players = 36. But then the \u201ctwo players she had grouped with before\u201d info is irrelevant to the count? That info would be useless.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 the info must be relevant. Possibly: She recognized 3 players from earlier weekends (2 in one group + 1 in another), but maybe those 3 players each appear in *multiple groups this weekend*, causing the total unique to be less than 36.\n\nBut problem doesn\u2019t explicitly say that. Maybe the intended meaning: The only repeats during the weekend were those 3 players each appearing twice? Or perhaps: She only grouped with those previous players again in those two groups; other 36-3=33 appearances were all unique people. But then the total unique = 33? That would assume 33 different new people + 3 known from before = 36 unique total. Yes \u2014 no repeats except possibly the 3 known players could be repeats? Wait, if no repeats within weekend, then total unique = 36, so info on them being known before is irrelevant for counting.\n\nUnless \u2014 the \u201ctwo players\u201d in the first group are the same person appearing twice across weekend? No, group with 4 others, so \u201ctwo players\u201d means two distinct.\n\nPerhaps she played with some players multiple times in the weekend, but the only such repeated players were these 3 from earlier weekends. That would mean: among the 36 appearances, 3 players appear twice each (or appear in both groups A and B?), reducing unique count.\n\nLet\u2019s assign variables:\nLet the 3 players from earlier weekends be X, Y, Z.  \nX and Y are the two players in one group. Z is the one player in another group.\n\nNow suppose each of X, Y, Z appears in exactly 2 groups during the weekend. Then their appearances count: X:2, Y:2, Z:2. So that\u2019s 6 appearances accounted for by 3 people. Remaining appearances = 36 - 6 = 30, each by a unique new player seen only once.\n\nSo unique players = 30 new + 3 old = 33.  \n\nBut why assume they appear twice? Because if they appear only once, their info is irrelevant to unique count. So likely the \u201cincluded two players she had grouped with before\u201d means those players also appear in another group during the weekend \u2014 but problem doesn\u2019t state that explicitly. Hmm.\n\nMaybe interpretation: The only repeated players across the weekend were the ones she knew before. Specifically: The two players she knew before (in one group) also appeared in a second group each (maybe not both in same second group). The one player she knew before (in another group) also appeared in a second group.\n\nBut then how many unique players? Each of the 3 known players appears twice. So 6 appearances are duplicates from known players. Therefore 36 total appearances \u2192 36 - 3 extra appearances = 33 unique players.\n\nYes, that matches the \u201conly repeats during weekend were those 3 players\u201d logic.\n\nThus answer = 33.\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
