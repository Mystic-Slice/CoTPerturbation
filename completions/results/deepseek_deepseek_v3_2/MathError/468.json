{"id": 468, "question": "A shopping center sells T-shirts at $8 each, a sweater at $18,  and a jacket at $80. The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. The sales tax is 5%.  Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, four sweaters, and five jackets for his children. How much does Kevin have to pay for all the items, including the sales tax?", "solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $480 = $<<5/100*480=24>>24.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $<<480+24=504>>504. including the sales tax.\n#### 504", "clean_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.", "perturbed_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $41.", "answer": 72.0, "perturbed_answer": 41.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "Let\u2019s continue from the partial solution.  \n\n**Step 1: Jacket price before discount**  \nEach jacket = $80.  \nNumber of jackets = 5.  \nTotal before discount = \\( 5 \\times 80 = 400 \\).  \n\n**Step 2: Apply 10% discount on jackets**  \nDiscount = \\( 10\\% \\) of \\( 400 \\) = \\( 0.10 \\times 400 = 40 \\).  \nPrice after discount = \\( 400 - 40 = 360 \\).  \n\n**Step 3: Subtotal before tax**  \nT-shirts = \\( 48 \\)  \nSweaters = \\( 72 \\)  \nJackets after discount = \\( 360 \\)  \nSubtotal = \\( 48 + 72 + 360 = 480 \\).  \n\n**Step 4: Add 5% sales tax**  \nTax = \\( 5\\% \\) of \\( 480 \\) = \\( 0.05 \\times 480 = 24 \\).  \nTotal with tax = \\( 480 + 24 = 504 \\).  \n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_clean": "504", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s correct the calculation for the sweaters and then proceed step-by-step.  \n\n**Step 1: T-shirts**  \n6 \u00d7 $8 = $48 \u2705  \n\n**Step 2: Sweaters**  \n4 \u00d7 $18 = $72 (not $41)  \n\n**Step 3: Jackets**  \nRegular price per jacket = $80  \nDiscount = 10% \u2192 discount per jacket = $80 \u00d7 0.10 = $8  \nSale price per jacket = $80 \u2212 $8 = $72  \nNumber of jackets = 5  \nCost for jackets before tax = 5 \u00d7 $72 = $360  \n\n**Step 4: Total before tax**  \nT-shirts: $48  \nSweaters: $72  \nJackets: $360  \nSum = $48 + $72 + $360 = $480  \n\n**Step 5: Sales tax**  \nTax rate = 5%  \nTax amount = $480 \u00d7 0.05 = $24  \n\n**Step 6: Total after tax**  \n$480 + $24 = $504  \n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_perturbed": "504"}
