{"id": 5863, "question": "Mary is making a spinach quiche. She takes 40 ounces of raw spinach and cooks it until it's 20% of its initial volume. If she mixes the spinach with 6 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of eggs, what is the total volume of the quiche?", "solution": "First find the cooked volume of the spinach: 40 ounces * 20% = <<40*20*.01=8>>8 ounces\nThen add that to the volume of the other ingredients to find the total volume: 8 ounces + 6 ounces + 4 ounces = <<8+6+4=18>>18 ounces\n#### 18", "clean_solution": "First find the cooked volume of the spinach: 40 ounces * 20% = 8 ounces", "perturbed_solution": "First find the cooked volume of the spinach: 40 ounces * 20% = 7 ounces", "answer": 8.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "The cooked spinach is 8 ounces.  \nShe adds 6 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of eggs.  \nTotal volume = \\( 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 \\) ounces.  \n\n#### 18", "answer_solution_clean": "18", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s correct the calculation first.  \n\nThe spinach is cooked until it\u2019s **20% of its initial volume**, not weight.  \nThe problem says she takes **40 ounces of raw spinach** \u2014 that\u2019s weight, not volume.  \nBut since the question asks for **total volume of the quiche**, we must assume the 40 ounces is the **initial volume** (otherwise we can\u2019t solve without density).  \n\nSo:  \nInitial spinach volume = 40 ounces (volume units)  \nCooked spinach volume = \\( 40 \\times 0.20 = 8 \\) ounces (volume).  \n\nNow she mixes with:  \n- Cream cheese: 6 ounces (volume)  \n- Eggs: 4 ounces (volume)  \n\nTotal volume = \\( 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 \\) ounces.  \n\n#### 18", "answer_solution_perturbed": "18"}
