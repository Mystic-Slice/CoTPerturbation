{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = 36.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = 81.", "answer": 36.0, "perturbed_answer": 81.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "After the increase, the total grapes needed per year is \\( 180 + 36 = 216 \\) kilograms.  \n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "First, let's correct the calculation in the partial solution.  \n\nBorris uses 90 kg every 6 months, so in a year:  \n\\( 90 \\times 2 = 180 \\) kg per year.  \n\nIncreasing production by 20% means:  \n\\( 180 \\times 0.20 = 36 \\) kg increase.  \n\nTotal needed after increase:  \n\\( 180 + 36 = 216 \\) kg per year.  \n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
