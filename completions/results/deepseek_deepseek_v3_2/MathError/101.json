{"id": 101, "question": "Marcy is a makeup artist and has agreed to do some makeup for her friend's wedding. The only makeup she has limited stock of is lip gloss so she counts how many tubes she needs. Each tube of lip gloss will hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. Marcy decides to bring 6 tubs of lip gloss, each of which holds 2 tubes of lip gloss, and this will be the exact amount she needs for everyone's makeup. How many people is Marcy painting with makeup?", "solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = <<6*2=12>>12 tubes of lip gloss.\nSo she must be applying makeup to 12 tubes of lip gloss * 3 people per tube of lip gloss = <<12*3=36>>36 people.\n#### 36", "clean_solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = 12 tubes of lip gloss.", "perturbed_solution": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = 50 tubes of lip gloss.", "answer": 12.0, "perturbed_answer": 50.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "Each tube of lip gloss is enough for 3 people.  \nSo 12 tubes can serve \\( 12 \\times 3 = 36 \\) people.  \n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_clean": "36", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s correct the calculation step-by-step.  \n\nEach tub holds 2 tubes of lip gloss.  \nShe brings 6 tubs, so:  \n\\[\n6 \\text{ tubs} \\times 2 \\text{ tubes per tub} = 12 \\text{ tubes}\n\\]  \n\nEach tube is enough for 3 people\u2019s makeup.  \nSo total people:  \n\\[\n12 \\text{ tubes} \\times 3 \\text{ people per tube} = 36 \\text{ people}\n\\]  \n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_perturbed": "36"}
