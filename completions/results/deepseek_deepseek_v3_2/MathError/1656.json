{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 30 feet long", "answer": 75.0, "perturbed_answer": 30.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "The trees are each 1.5 feet wide at maturity.  \nTo cover 75 feet, she needs:  \n\\( 75 \\div 1.5 = 50 \\) trees.  \n\nEach tree costs $8.00, so total cost:  \n\\( 50 \\times 8 = 400 \\) dollars.  \n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_clean": "400", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s correct the fence length calculation first.  \n\n3 feet are in 1 yard, so:  \n25 yards \u00d7 3 feet/yard = 75 feet long.  \n\nEach mature tree width = 1.5 feet.  \nNumber of trees needed = fence length in feet \u00f7 tree width in feet:  \n75 \u00f7 1.5 = 50 trees.  \n\nEach tree costs $8.00.  \nTotal cost = 50 \u00d7 $8 = $400.  \n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_perturbed": "400"}
