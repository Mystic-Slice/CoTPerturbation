{"id": 5897, "question": "Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?", "solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 toy cars\nGrandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 toy cars.\nAll the family together gave Olaf 10 +15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = <<10+15+6+5+10=46>>46.\nAdding the cars Olaf already had, Olaf's collection has 150 + 46 = <<150+46=196>>196 cars.\n#### 196", "clean_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars", "perturbed_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 6 toy cars", "answer": 5.0, "perturbed_answer": 6.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "Let\u2019s go step by step.  \n\nFrom the partial solution:  \n- Dad: 10 cars  \n- Mom: 10 + 5 = 15 cars  \n- Auntie: 6 cars  \n- Uncle: 6 \u2212 1 = 5 cars  \n\nNow, the problem says:  \n> Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle.  \n\nUncle gave 5 cars, so Grandpa gave:  \n2 \u00d7 5 = 10 cars.  \n\nInitial collection: 150 cars.  \n\nGifts total:  \nDad (10) + Mom (15) + Auntie (6) + Uncle (5) + Grandpa (10) = 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 46 cars.  \n\nTotal after gifts:  \n150 + 46 = 196 cars.  \n\n#### 196", "answer_solution_clean": "196", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s go step by step.  \n\nFrom the partial solution:  \n- Dad gave 10 cars.  \n- Mom gave 5 more than Dad \u2192 10 + 5 = 15 cars.  \n- Auntie gave 6 cars.  \n- Uncle gave 1 less than Auntie \u2192 6 \u2212 1 = 5 cars.  \n\nNow check the problem statement:  \nIt says \u201cGrandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle.\u201d  \nUncle gave 5 cars, so Grandpa gave 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 cars.  \n\nInitial collection: 150 cars.  \n\nGifts received:  \nDad: 10  \nMom: 15  \nAuntie: 6  \nUncle: 5  \nGrandpa: 10  \n\nTotal gifts = 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 46 cars.  \n\nNew total = 150 + 46 = 196 cars.  \n\n#### 196", "answer_solution_perturbed": "196"}
