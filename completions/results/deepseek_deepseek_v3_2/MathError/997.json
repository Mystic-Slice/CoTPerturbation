{"id": 997, "question": "Ittymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?", "solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.\nIf they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=12 fish.", "perturbed_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=89 fish.", "answer": 12.0, "perturbed_answer": 89.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "#### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s go step by step.  \n\nFrom the partial solution:  \n- Dog eats 2 eyes, Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes \u2192 total eyes = \\( 2 + 22 = 24 \\) eyes.  \n- Each fish has 2 eyes \u2192 number of fish = \\( 24 / 2 = 12 \\) fish.  \n\nThe problem says:  \nIttymangnark catches enough fish for all three to split equally, then after splitting, Oomyapeck gets all the eyes.  \n\nIf there are 12 fish total, they split them equally among 3 people:  \nEach person gets \\( 12 / 3 = 4 \\) fish to eat.  \n\nSo:  \nIttymangnark gets 4 fish to eat,  \nKingnook gets 4 fish to eat,  \nOomyapeck gets 4 fish to eat.  \n\nThe eyes part was just to find total fish; eating the fish flesh is separate from Oomyapeck eating the eyes.  \n\nThus each of them is given **4 fish** to eat.  \n\n#### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
