{"id": 7119, "question": "Jerry was asked by her mom to do grocery shopping. He needs to buy 2 liters of mustard oil that costs $13 per liter, 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta that costs $4 per pound, and 1  pound of pasta sauce that costs $5. If Jerry can keep the rest of the $50 after grocery shopping, how much money will he have?", "solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $<<13*2=26>>26.\nThe cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 x 3 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nSo, Jerry spent a total of $26 + $12 + $5 = $<<26+12+5=43>>43 for grocery shopping.\nThus, Jerry will have $50 - $43 = $<<50-43=7>>7 for himself.\n#### 7", "clean_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $26.", "perturbed_solution": "The cost of 2 liters of mustard oil is $13 x 2 = $98.", "answer": 26.0, "perturbed_answer": 98.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "The cost of 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 \u00d7 3 = $12.  \nThe cost of 1 pound of pasta sauce is $5.  \nTotal cost = $26 + $12 + $5 = $43.  \nJerry started with $50, so the money left = $50 \u2212 $43 = $7.  \n\n#### 7", "answer_solution_clean": "7", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's correct the calculation for the mustard oil first.  \n\nThe cost of 2 liters at $13 per liter is:  \n\\( 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\) dollars, not $98.  \n\nNow, the cost of 3 pounds of pasta at $4 per pound:  \n\\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) dollars.  \n\nThe cost of 1 pound of pasta sauce:  \n\\( 1 \\times 5 = 5 \\) dollars.  \n\nTotal cost:  \n\\( 26 + 12 + 5 = 43 \\) dollars.  \n\nJerry starts with $50, so the money left is:  \n\\( 50 - 43 = 7 \\) dollars.  \n\n#### 7", "answer_solution_perturbed": "7"}
