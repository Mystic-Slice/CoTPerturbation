{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= 8 dollars that Billy should contribute.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= 1 dollars that Billy should contribute.", "answer": 8.0, "perturbed_answer": 1.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "First, the total cost for both meals is $25 per meal \u00d7 2 = $50.  \nA 20% tip on $50 is $50 \u00d7 0.2 = $10.  \nBilly wants to cover 80% of that tip, so he pays $10 \u00d7 0.8 = $8.  \n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "First, the total cost for both meals is $50.  \nA 20% tip on $50 is \\( 50 \\times 0.2 = 10 \\).  \nBilly wants to cover 80% of this tip: \\( 10 \\times 0.8 = 8 \\).  \n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
