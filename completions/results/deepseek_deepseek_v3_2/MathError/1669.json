That only works if \u201c56 sheep and goats\u201d means 56 sheep (and goats are separate).  \n\nBut then goats = 104, sheep = 56, cows = 40:  \nTotal = 40 + 56 + 104 = 200. Yes, that works.  \n\nSo the statement \u201c56 sheep and goats\u201d must be read as \u201c56 sheep, and goats\u201d meaning sheep = 56, goats unknown.  \n\nThus goats = 200 \u2212 (40 + 56) = 104.  \n\nPartial solution already gave the correct arithmetic.  \n\nFinal answer:  \n\n#### 104", "answer_solution_clean": "104", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s go step by step.  \n\nAnimals other than goats: cows + sheep = 40 + 56 = 96.  \n\nTotal animals = 200.  \n\nGoats = 200 \u2212 96 = 104.  \n\nThe partial solution mistakenly said 101, but 200 \u2212 96 = 104.  \n\n#### 104", "answer_solution_perturbed": "104"}
