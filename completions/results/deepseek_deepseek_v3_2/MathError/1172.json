{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 9 wooden planks.", "answer": 50.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "From Colbert\u2019s parents, he gets half of the 200 planks, which is \\( 200 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 100 \\) planks.  \nFrom his friends, he gets 20 planks.  \nFrom his storage, he already has 50 planks.  \n\nTotal planks already available:  \n\\( 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 \\) planks.  \n\nHe needs 200 planks in total, so the number he must buy from the store is:  \n\\( 200 - 170 = 30 \\) planks.  \n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s go step by step.  \n\nTotal planks needed: \\( 200 \\)  \n\nFrom storage: \\( \\frac14 \\) of \\( 200 = 50 \\) planks.  \nFrom parents: \\( \\frac12 \\) of \\( 200 = 100 \\) planks.  \nFrom friends: \\( 20 \\) planks.  \n\nSo far: \\( 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 \\) planks.  \n\nRemaining to buy from store: \\( 200 - 170 = 30 \\) planks.  \n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
