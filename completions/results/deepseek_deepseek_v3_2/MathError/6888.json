{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $2 more when not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $7 more when not on sale.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs \\( 216 / 54 = 4 \\) dollars.  \nIf not on sale, selling 54 pints would yield \\( 216 + 108 = 324 \\) dollars.  \nThus, the regular price per pint is \\( 324 / 54 = 6 \\) dollars.  \nThe difference is \\( 6 - 4 = 2 \\) dollars more per pint when not on sale.  \n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's go through the reasoning carefully.  \n\nOn sale:  \nSold 54 pints for $216 \u2192 price per pint = \\( 216 \\div 54 = 4 \\) dollars.  \n\nWithout sale:  \nThey would have made \\( 216 + 108 = 324 \\) dollars for the same 54 pints.  \nSo price per pint without sale = \\( 324 \\div 54 = 6 \\) dollars.  \n\nDifference = \\( 6 - 4 = 2 \\) dollars more when not on sale.  \n\nThe partial solution incorrectly said $7 more, but that\u2019s a math slip.
