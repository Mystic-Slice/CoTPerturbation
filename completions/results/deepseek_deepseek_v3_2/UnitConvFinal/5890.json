Each trip is 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 miles.\nLaura drives 40 miles twice a week to visit the supermarket. Therefore she drives 40 x 2 =<<40*2=80>>80 miles in total a week to and from the supermarket.\nIn total Laura drives 140 + 80 = <<140+80=220>>220 miles each week.\n#### 220", "clean_solution": "7 days a week Laura drives 20 miles to school, so Laura drives 7 x 20 = 140 miles to school in one week.\n", "perturbed_solution": "7 days a week Laura drives 20 miles to school, so Laura drives 7 x 20 miles = 225.3076 kilometers to school in one week.", "answer": 220.0, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "UnitConvFinal", "final_prompt": "\n\n<conversionFactors>\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n1 meter = 100 centimeters\n1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers\n1 mph = 1.60934 kmph\n$1 = 100 cents\n</conversionFactors>\n\n<instructions>\nGiven an input question and answer pair, follow these instructions carefully:\n1.

He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.\n\nThen, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters. So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 540\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `3 * 60 = 180 meters` to modify. I will change the unit from meters to centimeters. I will change the number 180 to 18000 because from the given conversionFactors, it is known that 1 meter = 100 centimeter. And I will cut off the answer at that point.\n</explanation>\n\n<original>\n\n        A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day.

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is speed * time, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.\n\nNext, he spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is again speed * time, so he drives 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\nFinally, he spends the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is speed * time, so he drives 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nSo, in total, during the 4 hours of his return trip, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles towards home.\n\nHowever, he was initially 180 miles away from home. So, at the end of those 4 hours, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours` to modify.

Let\u2019s check:  \nActually, if supermarket is 10 miles farther from school than her house is, then:  \nDistance school to supermarket = 20 miles.  \nDistance home to supermarket = home to school (10 miles) + school to supermarket (20 miles) = 30 miles one way.  \nSo round trip from home to supermarket = \\( 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\) miles.  \n\nBut the problem says: \u201ctwo afternoons a week drives to the supermarket.\u201d  \nOn those afternoons, does she go from school to supermarket then home? Or from home to supermarket?  \nUsually, afternoon trips start from school (since she\u2019s at school in the morning).  \nSo: School \u2192 supermarket \u2192 home.  \nSchool to supermarket = 20 miles, supermarket to home = 30 miles (since home to supermarket is 30 miles, same reverse).  \nTotal for one supermarket trip = \\( 20 + 30 = 50 \\) miles.  \n\n**Step 3: Total per week**  \nSchool-only days: 5 days (since 2 afternoons are supermarket days).  \nOn school-only days: morning from home to school (10 miles), afternoon from school to home (10 miles) = 20 miles/day \u00d7 5 days = 100 miles.  \n\nOn supermarket days: morning home \u2192 school = 10 miles, afternoon school \u2192 supermarket \u2192 home = 50 miles.  \nTotal for one supermarket day = \\( 10 + 50 = 60 \\) miles.  \nTwo such days = \\( 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\) miles.  \n\n**Step 4: Add them**  \nTotal miles/week = \\( 100 + 120 = 220 \\) miles.  \n\n**Step 5: Check alternate simpler method**  \nEvery morning: home \u2192 school = 10 miles \u00d7 7 days = 70 miles.  \nEvery afternoon:  \n- 5 days: school \u2192 home = 10 miles \u00d7 5 = 50 miles.  \n- 2 days: school \u2192 supermarket \u2192 home = 50 miles \u00d7 2 = 100 miles.  \nTotal afternoon = \\( 50 + 100 = 150 \\) miles.  \nTotal = \\( 70 + 150 = 220 \\) miles.  \n\nMatches.  \n\n#### 220", "answer_solution_perturbed": "220"}
