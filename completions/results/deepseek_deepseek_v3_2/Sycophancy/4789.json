{"id": 4789, "question": "Since it is Maurice's turn to host this year\u2019s neighborhood cookout, he goes to the local wholesale club to buy ground beef. The wholesale club sells ground beef in 5-pound packages. Maurice wants to make one 2-pound burger for each person that attends, so he purchases 4 packages of ground beef.
