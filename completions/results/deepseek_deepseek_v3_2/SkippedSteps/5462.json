{"id": 5462, "question": "Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?", "solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = <<3*8=24>>24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = <<3*6=18>>18 miles\nNow add the number of miles both people skated to find the total distance between them: 18 miles + 24 miles = <<18+24=42>>42 miles\n#### 42", "clean_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles", "perturbed_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "Ann\u2019s distance: \\( 6 \\text{ mph} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 18 \\text{ miles} \\)  \n\nThey skate in opposite directions, so total distance apart:  \n\\( 24 \\text{ miles} + 18 \\text{ miles} = 42 \\text{ miles} \\)  \n\n#### 42", "answer_solution_clean": "42", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s complete the solution step by step.  \n\nAnn\u2019s speed = 6 miles/hour  \nGlenda\u2019s speed = 8 miles/hour  \nTime traveled = 3 hours  \n\nDistance Ann travels:  \n\\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\) miles  \n\nDistance Glenda travels:  \n\\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\) miles  \n\nThey skate in opposite directions, so total distance apart:  \n\\( 18 + 24 = 42 \\) miles  \n\n#### 42", "answer_solution_perturbed": "42"}
