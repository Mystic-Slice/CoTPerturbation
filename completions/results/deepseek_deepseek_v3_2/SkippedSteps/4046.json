{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.  \nTotal earnings for two months: $200 + $350 = $550.  \nEarnings per hour: $10.  \nTotal hours: $550 \u00f7 $10 = 55 hours.\n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "For the two months combined, Sam earned $200 + $350 = $550.  \nSince he earns $10 per hour, the total hours spent tutoring is $550 \u00f7 $10 = 55 hours.  \n\n#### 55", "answer_solution_perturbed": "55"}
