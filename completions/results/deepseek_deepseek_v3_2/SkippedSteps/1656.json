{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "Each tree at maturity is 1.5 feet wide, so to cover 75 feet, she needs:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{75}{1.5} = 50 \\text{ trees}\n\\]\n\nEach tree costs $8.00, so the total cost is:\n\n\\[\n50 \\times 8 = 400\n\\]\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_clean": "400", "completed_solution_perturbed": "First, convert the fence length to feet:  \n25 yards \u00d7 3 feet/yard = 75 feet.\n\nEach tree at maturity is 1.5 feet wide.  \nNumber of trees needed = 75 feet \u00f7 1.5 feet/tree = 50 trees.\n\nEach tree costs $8.00.  \nTotal cost = 50 trees \u00d7 $8.00 = $400.\n\n#### 400", "answer_solution_perturbed": "400"}
