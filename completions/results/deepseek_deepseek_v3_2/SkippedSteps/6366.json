{"id": 6366, "question": "Elsa started the day with 40 marbles.  At breakfast, she lost 3 marbles while playing.  At lunchtime, she gave her best friend Susie 5 marbles.  In the afternoon, Elsa's mom bought her a new bag with 12 marbles.  Susie came back and gave Elsa twice as many marbles as she received at lunch.
