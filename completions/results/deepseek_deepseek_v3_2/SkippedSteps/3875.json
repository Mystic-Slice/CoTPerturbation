{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "The third snail travels at five times the speed of the second snail.  \nSince the second snail\u2019s speed is twice the first snail\u2019s speed, the third snail\u2019s speed is \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\) times the first snail\u2019s speed.  \n\nIf the first snail takes 20 minutes, the third snail will take \\( 20 / 10 = 2 \\) minutes.  \n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The third snail travels at five times the speed of the second snail.  \nSince the second snail\u2019s speed is twice the first snail\u2019s speed, the third snail\u2019s speed is \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) times the first snail\u2019s speed.  \n\nIf the first snail takes 20 minutes, then the third snail, going 10 times faster, will take \\(20 / 10 = 2\\) minutes.  \n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
