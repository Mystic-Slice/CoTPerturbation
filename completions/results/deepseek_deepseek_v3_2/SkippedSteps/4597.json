{"id": 4597, "question": "Mason is mixing up some salad dressing. He takes a bowl that holds 150 ml and fills it 2/3rds with oil and 1/3rd with vinegar. The oil weighs 5 g/ml and the vinegar weighs 4 g/ml. How many grams does the salad dressing weigh?", "solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = <<150*2/3=100>>100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = <<150*1/3=50>>50 ml\nNow find the weight of the oil by multiplying the volume by the weight/volume ratio: 100 ml * 5 g/ml = <<100*5=500>>500 g\nDo the same procedure with the weight and weight/volume ratio of the vinegar to find its weight: 50 ml * 4 g/ml = <<50*4=200>>200 g\nNow add the weight of the oil and the vinegar to find the weight of the salad dressing: 500 g + 200 g = <<500+200=700>>700 g\n#### 700", "clean_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 50 ml", "perturbed_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 50 ml\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "Now, find the weight of the oil:  \n\\( 100 \\text{ ml} \\times 5 \\text{ g/ml} = 500 \\text{ g} \\)  \n\nThen, find the weight of the vinegar:  \n\\( 50 \\text{ ml} \\times 4 \\text{ g/ml} = 200 \\text{ g} \\)  \n\nAdd them together:  \n\\( 500 \\text{ g} + 200 \\text{ g} = 700 \\text{ g} \\)  \n\n#### 700", "answer_solution_clean": "700", "completed_solution_perturbed": "First, calculate the weight of the oil:  \n\\( 100 \\text{ ml} \\times 5 \\text{ g/ml} = 500 \\text{ g} \\)  \n\nThen, calculate the weight of the vinegar:  \n\\( 50 \\text{ ml} \\times 4 \\text{ g/ml} = 200 \\text{ g} \\)  \n\nTotal weight of the salad dressing:  \n\\( 500 \\text{ g} + 200 \\text{ g} = 700 \\text{ g} \\)  \n\n#### 700", "answer_solution_perturbed": "700"}
