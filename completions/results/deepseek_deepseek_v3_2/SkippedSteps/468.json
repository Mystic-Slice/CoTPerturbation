{"id": 468, "question": "A shopping center sells T-shirts at $8 each, a sweater at $18,  and a jacket at $80. The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. The sales tax is 5%.  Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, four sweaters, and five jackets for his children. How much does Kevin have to pay for all the items, including the sales tax?", "solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $480 = $<<5/100*480=24>>24.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $<<480+24=504>>504. including the sales tax.\n#### 504", "clean_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $400.", "perturbed_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $400.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "First, apply the 10% discount to the jackets:  \n10% of $400 = \\( 0.10 \\times 400 = 40 \\) dollars discount.  \nSo discounted price for jackets = \\( 400 - 40 = 360 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal before tax:  \n\\( 48 + 72 + 360 = 480 \\) dollars.\n\nSales tax is 5%:  \n\\( 0.05 \\times 480 = 24 \\) dollars tax.\n\nTotal including tax:  \n\\( 480 + 24 = 504 \\) dollars.\n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_clean": "504", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let's calculate step-by-step:  \n\n- T-shirts: \\( 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\)  \n- Sweaters: \\( 4 \\times 18 = 72 \\)  \n- Jackets before discount: \\( 5 \\times 80 = 400 \\)  \n  Jacket discount \\( 10\\% \\) means price at \\( 90\\% \\) of original:  \n  Jacket discounted price each: \\( 80 \\times 0.90 = 72 \\)  \n  For 5 jackets: \\( 5 \\times 72 = 360 \\)  \n\nSubtotal before tax:  \n\\( 48 + 72 + 360 = 480 \\)  \n\nSales tax \\( 5\\% \\): \\( 480 \\times 0.05 = 24 \\)  \n\nTotal amount to pay:  \n\\( 480 + 24 = 504 \\)  \n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_perturbed": "504"}
