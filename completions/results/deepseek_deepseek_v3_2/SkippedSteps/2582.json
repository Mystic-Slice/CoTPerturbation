{"id": 2582, "question": "Markus is twice the age of his son, and Markus's son is twice the age of Markus's grandson.  If the sum of the ages of Markus, his son, and his grandson is 140 years, then how many years old is Markus's grandson?", "solution": "Let \"x\" be the age of Markus's grandson.\nIf Markus's son is twice the age of Markus's grandson, then Markus's son is 2*x.\nIf Markus is twice the age of his son, then Markus is 2*2*x.\nTherefore, if the sum of the ages of Markus, his son, and his grandson is 140 years, then x+(2*x)+(2*2*x)=140 years.\nSimplifying the equation, we see that 7*x=140 years.\nTherefore, the age of Markus's grandson is x=20 years old.\n#### 20", "clean_solution": "Let \"x\" be the age of Markus's grandson.", "perturbed_solution": "Let \"x\" be the age of Markus's grandson.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "Let \\( x \\) be the grandson\u2019s age.  \n\nThe son is twice the grandson\u2019s age:  \n\\[\n\\text{Son's age} = 2x\n\\]  \n\nMarkus is twice the son\u2019s age:  \n\\[\n\\text{Markus's age} = 2 \\times (2x) = 4x\n\\]  \n\nSum of their ages is 140:  \n\\[\n4x + 2x + x = 140\n\\]  \n\\[\n7x = 140\n\\]  \n\\[\nx = 20\n\\]  \n\nThus, the grandson is \\( 20 \\) years old.  \n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_clean": "20", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let \\( x \\) be the age of Markus\u2019s grandson.  \n\nMarkus\u2019s son is twice the age of the grandson:  \n\\[\n\\text{Son's age} = 2x\n\\]  \n\nMarkus is twice the age of his son:  \n\\[\n\\text{Markus's age} = 2 \\times (2x) = 4x\n\\]  \n\nSum of their ages is 140:  \n\\[\nx + 2x + 4x = 140\n\\]  \n\\[\n7x = 140\n\\]  \n\\[\nx = 20\n\\]  \n\nMarkus\u2019s grandson is \\( 20 \\) years old.  \n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_perturbed": "20"}
