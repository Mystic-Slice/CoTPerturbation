{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "Let\u2019s go step-by-step.  \n\nMona joined **9 groups**, each with **4 other players**.  \nTotal player appearances (not counting Mona) = \\( 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\) appearances.  \n\nBut these appearances could be repeats of the same player.  \n\nWe know:  \n- One group included **2 players** she had grouped with before that weekend.  \n- Another group included **1 player** she had grouped with before that weekend.  \n\nThe \u201cbefore that weekend\u201d means these are **repeat players from earlier weekends**, not repeats within this weekend.  \nBut the problem asks: **How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?**  \nThat means: count all distinct people she played with during this weekend, regardless of whether she knew them before.  \n\nHowever, the given info about \u201cbefore that weekend\u201d only matters if it tells us about repeats **within this weekend**? Let\u2019s think:  \n\nActually, the \u201cbefore that weekend\u201d means those players were not new to her overall, but they are still unique players she played with **this weekend** (they count in the total for this weekend).  \n\nBut the 36 appearances count the same player multiple times if she was in multiple groups with them **this weekend**.  \n\nWe need to know: Did any players appear in more than one group **this weekend**? The problem doesn\u2019t explicitly say, except:  \n- One group had 2 players she had grouped with before that weekend.  \n- Another group had 1 player she had grouped with before that weekend.  \n\nThese two facts don\u2019t necessarily mean repeats within this weekend unless those players were in multiple groups this weekend. But the problem doesn\u2019t say they were in multiple groups.  \n\nSo maybe the intended interpretation:  \nShe had **9 groups \u00d7 4 other players = 36 slots**.  \nIf no player appeared in more than one group this weekend, then unique players = 36.  \nBut if there were repeats within the weekend, we need to subtract.  \n\nThe only possible repeats within the weekend would be if those \u201cbefore that weekend\u201d players were in more than one group this weekend. But the problem doesn\u2019t say that.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the \u201cbefore that weekend\u201d players are the **same person** in both groups?  \nIt says: \u201cOne of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before.\u201d  \nThat could mean:  \nGroup A: had old friends X and Y.  \nGroup B: had old friend Z.  \nOr maybe Group B had old friend X again? Then X would be in two groups, so total unique players = 36 \u2212 1 = 35.  \n\nBut the wording doesn\u2019t say \u201cthe same person\u201d appears in both groups. So likely all \u201cbefore\u201d players are different from each other, and no repeats within the weekend.  \n\nThen unique players = 36.  \n\nBut the problem likely has a trick:  \nIf she played with 36 appearances, but some players were in multiple groups, then unique < 36.  \nThe only clue to repeats is: she knew some from before, but that doesn\u2019t mean they repeated this weekend.  \n\nHowever, maybe the intended meaning:  \nThe \u201ctwo players she had grouped with before\u201d in one group, and the \u201cone person she had grouped with before\u201d in another group, are **the same person** counted in both? No, that would be 1 person in two groups, so 36 \u2212 1 = 35 unique.  \n\nBut if the \u201cone person\u201d in the second group is one of the two from the first group, then:  \nFirst group: old friends A, B.  \nSecond group: old friend A again.  \nThen A is in two groups, so total appearances = 36, but A counted twice in appearances, so unique players = 36 \u2212 1 = 35.  \n\nThat\u2019s the only way the given info changes the count.  \n\nSo:  \nTotal appearances = 36.  \nOne repeat (A appears twice), so unique = 35.  \n\nThus:  \n\n#### 35", "answer_solution_clean": "35", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Let\u2019s go step by step.  \n\nMona joins 9 groups, each with 4 other players.  \nTotal player appearances (not counting Mona) = \\( 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\) appearances.  \n\nBut some players might have been in more than one group with her.  \n\nWe are told:  \n- One group had 2 players she had grouped with before that weekend (so these 2 are repeats from earlier in the weekend, not from before the weekend? Wait, careful: \"before that weekend\" means before the weekend started, so they are not repeats within the weekend, but repeats from earlier play before the weekend. That means they are still unique within this weekend unless they appear again in another group this weekend.)  \n\nActually, let's parse:  \n> One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before.  \n\nThis means:  \n- In one group, 2 of the 4 players were already known to Mona from before the weekend.  \n- In another group, 1 of the 4 players was already known to Mona from before the weekend.  \n\nBut the question asks: \"How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?\"  \nThat means: count all distinct players she played with during the weekend, regardless of whether she knew them before.  \n\nSo the \"before that weekend\" info is irrelevant for counting unique players *this weekend* unless those same players appear again in different groups this weekend. But the problem doesn\u2019t say they appear again; it just says in those groups some were repeats from before the weekend.  \n\nSo:  \nTotal appearances = 36.  \nIf all 36 appearances were distinct players, unique players = 36.  \nBut could there be repeats within the weekend? The problem doesn\u2019t mention any player grouping with her more than once *during the weekend*, so we assume all 36 appearances are distinct people.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 that seems too straightforward. Maybe the \"before that weekend\" is meant to mislead, but maybe it implies those players are not new to her, but still unique within the weekend count.  \n\nActually, re-reading: The question is \"How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?\"  \nThat means: Over the weekend, she met some players, possibly some she already knew from before, but still unique players *this weekend*. If she played with the same person in two different groups this weekend, that person would be counted once. But the problem doesn\u2019t say she played with anyone twice during the weekend.  \n\nSo:  \nEach group: 4 new-to-this-weekend players? Not necessarily new to her life, but new to this weekend\u2019s set. But if a player appears in two groups this weekend, they\u2019d be counted once.  \n\nBut the problem gives no info about repeats within the weekend, so we must assume all 36 appearances are 36 different people.  \n\nThus unique players = 36.  \n\nBut let\u2019s check:  \nGroup 1: 4 players (A,B,C,D)  \nGroup 2: 4 players (E,F,G,H)  \n\u2026 etc.  \nNo repeats across groups mentioned.  \n\nSo answer = 36.  \n\nBut maybe the trick: The \"two players she had grouped with before\" and \"one person she had grouped with before\" \u2014 if those are the same person? That would reduce unique count. But they are in different groups, so if one person is in both of those statements, that person would be counted twice in appearances but once in unique. But the problem says \"another group included one person she had grouped with before\" \u2014 that one person could be one of the two from the first group? Possibly.  \n\nLet\u2019s test:  \nSuppose before weekend she knew players X and Y.  \nIn one group this weekend, X and Y are in it.  \nIn another group this weekend, X is in it.  \nThen X appears in 2 groups this weekend, Y in 1 group, others all new.  \n\nTotal appearances = 36.  \nIf X appears twice, then unique players = 36 \u2212 1 = 35.  \n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t explicitly say the \"one person\" in the second group is one of the two from the first group. It just says \"another group included one person she had grouped with before\" \u2014 that person could be different from the two in the first group.  \n\nIf they are different:  \nBefore weekend she knew at least 3 players: X, Y, Z.  \nGroup P: has X and Y (both known before).  \nGroup Q: has Z (known before).  \nNo repeats within weekend. Then unique players = 36.  \n\nBut if the \"one person\" in the second group is one of the two from the first group, then unique players = 35.  \n\nWhich is more likely? Usually in such puzzles, they intend no within-weekend repeats unless stated. But here, \"another group included one person she had grouped with before\" \u2014 if that person is not necessarily one of the two earlier, then no within-weekend repeats.  \n\nBut if that person is one of the two earlier, then there is a within-weekend repeat. The problem doesn\u2019t specify, so we must assume minimal assumptions: no within-weekend repeats unless forced by info.  \n\nBut the info doesn\u2019t force it, so unique = 36.  \n\nBut many similar problems: \"Mona joined 9 groups of 4 others. One group had 2 players she had played with before that weekend, another group had 1 player she had played with before that weekend\" \u2014 they usually mean those are distinct pre-known players, so total known before = at least 3, but unique this weekend = 36.  \n\nGiven the partial solution says: \"Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\" \u2014 they are implying 36 unique.  \n\nThus final answer:  \n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_perturbed": "36"}
