{"id": 3018, "question": "Kara has to drink 4 ounces of water every time she takes her medication. Her medication instructions are to take one tablet three times a day. She followed the instructions for one week, but in the second week, she forgot twice on one day. How many ounces of water did she drink with her medication over those two weeks?", "solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = <<84*2=168>>168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = <<168-8=160>>160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.", "perturbed_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "First week: She drinks 84 ounces.  \n\nSecond week: She is supposed to drink 84 ounces if she follows instructions perfectly, but she forgot twice on one day.  \nIf she forgot twice in one day, that means she only took her medication once that day.  \nOn a normal day she drinks 12 ounces (3 doses \u00d7 4 oz each).  \nIf she only took it once, she drank 4 ounces that day.  \nSo she drank 12 \u2212 4 = 8 ounces less than normal that day.  \n\nNormal second week: 84 ounces  \nActual second week: 84 \u2212 8 = 76 ounces  \n\nTotal over two weeks: 84 + 76 = 160 ounces.  \n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Continuing the solution: In the first week, she drinks 84 ounces. In the second week, she normally would drink 84 ounces, but she forgot twice on one day. Forgetting twice means she missed two doses on that day, so she only took one dose. On that day, she drank 4 ounces instead of 12. So for the second week, she drank 12 ounces on 6 days and 4 ounces on 1 day: 12 \u00d7 6 + 4 = 72 + 4 = 76 ounces.
