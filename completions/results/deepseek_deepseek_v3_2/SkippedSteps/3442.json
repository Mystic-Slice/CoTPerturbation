{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2", "completed_solution_clean": "Gary can bake \\( 4 \\div 0.5 = 8 \\) cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.  \nFrom the remaining 2 pounds of flour, he can bake \\( 2 \\div \\frac{1}{5} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) cupcakes.  \n\nSelling price:  \nCakes: \\( 8 \\times 2.5 = 20 \\) dollars.  \nCupcakes: \\( 10 \\times 1 = 10 \\) dollars.  \n\nTotal earnings: \\( 20 + 10 = 30 \\) dollars.  \n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "Gary can bake 8 cakes from 4 pounds of flour.
