He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.\n\nThen, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters. So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 540\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `3 * 60 = 180 meters` to modify. I will change the unit from meters to centimeters. I will change the number 180 to 18000 because from the given conversionFactors, it is known that 1 meter = 100 centimeter.

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is speed * time, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.\n\nNext, he spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is again speed * time, so he drives 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\nFinally, he spends the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is speed * time, so he drives 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nSo, in total, during the 4 hours of his return trip, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles towards home.\n\nHowever, he was initially 180 miles away from home. So, at the end of those 4 hours, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours` to modify.
