He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.\n\nThen, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters. So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 540\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `3 * 60 = 180 meters` to modify. I will change the unit from meters to centimeters. I will change the number 180 to 18000 because from the given conversionFactors, it is known that 1 meter = 100 centimeter.

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is speed * time, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.\n\nNext, he spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is again speed * time, so he drives 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\nFinally, he spends the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is speed * time, so he drives 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nSo, in total, during the 4 hours of his return trip, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles towards home.\n\nHowever, he was initially 180 miles away from home. So, at the end of those 4 hours, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours` to modify.

Sam's rate**  \nSam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes.  \nIn 6 hours = \\( 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\) minutes,  \nNumber of widgets Sam made: \\( 360 \\div 10 = 36 \\) widgets.  \n\n**2. Jack's rate**  \nWhen Sam and Jack work together, they make 2 widgets in 15 minutes.  \nSam makes 1 widget in 10 minutes, so in 15 minutes Sam makes \\( 15/10 = 1.5 \\) widgets.  \nTogether they make 2 widgets in 15 minutes, so Jack makes \\( 2 - 1.5 = 0.5 \\) widgets in 15 minutes.  \nThus Jack\u2019s rate: \\( 0.5 \\) widgets per 15 minutes = \\( 1 \\) widget per 30 minutes? Wait \u2014 let's check carefully.  \n\nActually, simpler:  \nTogether rate = \\( 2 \\) widgets per 15 minutes = \\( 8 \\) widgets per hour.  \nSam\u2019s rate = \\( 1 \\) widget per 10 minutes = \\( 6 \\) widgets per hour.  \nSo Jack\u2019s rate = \\( 8 - 6 = 2 \\) widgets per hour.  \nThat means Jack takes \\( 60/2 = 30 \\) minutes per widget.  \n\nYes, so Jack\u2019s time per widget = 30 minutes.  \n\n**3. Jack\u2019s output in 4 hours**  \n4 hours = 240 minutes.  \nAt 30 minutes per widget: \\( 240 \\div 30 = 8 \\) widgets.  \n\nBut earlier partial solution said 16 widgets \u2014 that\u2019s wrong. Let\u2019s check:  \nIf Jack takes 15 minutes per widget (as partial solution incorrectly said), then 4 hours = 240 minutes \u2192 \\( 240/15 = 16 \\) widgets.  \nBut we just found Jack\u2019s rate is 30 minutes/widget, so that\u2019s wrong.  \n\nLet\u2019s re-derive Jack\u2019s rate from \u201c2 widgets every 15 minutes when Sam and Jack work together\u201d:  \nSam\u2019s rate = \\( 1/10 \\) widgets/minute.  \nLet Jack\u2019s rate = \\( 1/t_J \\) widgets/minute.  \nTogether: \\( 1/10 + 1/t_J = 2/15 \\) widgets/minute.  \nSo \\( 1/t_J = 2/15 - 1/10 = 4/30 - 3/30 = 1/30 \\).  \nSo \\( t_J = 30 \\) minutes/widget.  \n\nThus Jack\u2019s output in 4 hours (240 minutes): \\( 240/30 = 8 \\) widgets.  \n\n**4.
