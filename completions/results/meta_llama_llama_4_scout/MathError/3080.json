{"id": 3080, "question": "Tony has two fish. Every year, his parents buy him two more, but one of them dies.

Every year, he gets 2 more fish but then one dies, resulting in a net gain of 1 fish per year.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total number of fish after five years.\nThe initial number of fish is 2. For each of the 5 years, Tony gets 1 more fish than the previous year due to the net gain of 1 fish per year. So, after 5 years, he will have gained 5 more fish.\n\n## 3: Add the initial number of fish to the number gained over five years.\nStarting with 2 fish and gaining 5 more fish over the 5 years gives 2 + 5 = 7 fish.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 7", "answer_solution_clean": "7", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\nInitially, Tony has 2 fish.\n\nEach year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 - 1 = 1\n\nIn five years, he will have 5 more fish because 5 x 1 = 5\n\nIn five years he will have 7 fish because 2 + 5 = 7\n\nSo, let's recheck that: \n- Year 0: 2 fish\n- Year 1: 2 + 2 - 1 = 3\n- Year 2: 3 + 2 - 1 = 4\n- Year 3: 4 + 2 - 1 = 5\n- Year 4: 5 + 2 - 1 = 6\n- Year 5: 6 + 2 - 1 = 7\n\n#### 7", "answer_solution_perturbed": "7"}
