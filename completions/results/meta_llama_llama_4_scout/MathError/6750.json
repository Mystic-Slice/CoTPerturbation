The steps given are: \n1. The first two shipments of couscous added up to 7 + 13 = 20 pounds\n2. Adding that weight to the next day\u2019s shipment results in a total weight of 20 + 45 = 65 pounds\n3. Since each dish takes 5 pounds, then the restaurant makes 65/5 = 13 dishes\n\n## 2: Verify the calculations\nLet's verify the calculations:\n1. 7 + 13 = 20 pounds (Correct)\n2. 20 + 45 = 65 pounds (Correct)\n3. 65 / 5 = 13 (Correct)\n\n## 3: Provide the final answer\nThe calculations are accurate. The total number of dishes the restaurant can make is 13.\n\n#### 13", "answer_solution_perturbed": "13"}
