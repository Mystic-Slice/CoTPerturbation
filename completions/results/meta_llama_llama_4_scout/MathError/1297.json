We do this by multiplying the number of students with puppies by the percentage that also have parrots: 32 * 0.25 = 8.\n\n## 3: Determine the final answer.\nThe number of students who have both puppies and parrots is 8.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how many students have both puppies and parrots, we continue from the partial solution provided.\n\nGiven:\n- Total students = 40\n- Students with puppies = 40 * 0.8 = 32\n\nNow, we calculate the number of students who have both puppies and parrots.
