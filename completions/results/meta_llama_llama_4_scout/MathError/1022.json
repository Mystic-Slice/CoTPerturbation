Let's denote Leah's age as \\(L\\) and Rachel's age as \\(R\\). We have two pieces of information:\n1. \\(R = L + 4\\)\n2. \\(R + L = 34\\)\n\n## 2: Use the partial solution to find Leah's age\nThe partial solution states that if Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be \\(34 - 4 = 30\\). This implies that if Leah's age is \\(L\\), then Rachel's age would also be \\(L\\), and \\(L + L = 30\\). So, \\(2L = 30\\), which means \\(L = 15\\).\n\n## 3: Calculate Rachel's age using Leah's age\nGiven Leah's age \\(L = 15\\), and knowing Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, we find Rachel's age:\n\\(R = L + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19\\).\n\n## 4: Verify the solution\nTo ensure the solution is correct, let's verify that the sum of their ages is 34:\n\\(R + L = 19 + 15 = 34\\), which matches the given information.\n\n####\n19", "answer_solution_clean": "19", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and define variables\nLet's denote Rachel's age as \\(R\\) and Leah's age as \\(L\\).

The sum of their ages is 34, so \\(R + L = 34\\).\n\n## 2: Solve the system of equations\nFrom the first equation, we can express \\(R\\) in terms of \\(L\\): \\(R = L + 4\\).\n\n## 3: Substitute \\(R\\) in the second equation\nSubstituting \\(R = L + 4\\) into \\(R + L = 34\\), we get:\n\\[L + 4 + L = 34\\]\nSimplifying, we find:\n\\[2L + 4 = 34\\]\n\n## 4: Solve for \\(L\\)\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\\[2L = 30\\]\nDivide by 2:\n\\[L = 15\\]\n\n## 5: Find Rachel's age\nNow that we know Leah's age, we can find Rachel's age using \\(R = L + 4\\):\n\\[R = 15 + 4 = 19\\]\n\n## 6: Verify the solution\nLet's verify that the sum of their ages is indeed 34:\n\\[R + L = 19 + 15 = 34\\]\nThis confirms our solution.\n\n####\n19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "19"}
