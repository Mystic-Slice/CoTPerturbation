{"id": 5462, "question": "Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?", "solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = <<3*8=24>>24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = <<3*6=18>>18 miles\nNow add the number of miles both people skated to find the total distance between them: 18 miles + 24 miles = <<18+24=42>>42 miles\n#### 42", "clean_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = 18 miles", "perturbed_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = 19 miles", "answer": 18.0, "perturbed_answer": 19.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total distance between them, we need to add the distances they both traveled since they are moving in opposite directions.\n\nDistance Glenda traveled: 24 miles\nDistance Ann traveled: 18 miles\n\nTotal distance between them = 24 miles + 18 miles = 42 miles\n\n#### 42", "answer_solution_clean": "42", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total distance between them, we need to add the distances they both traveled since they are moving in opposite directions.\n\nDistance traveled by Glenda = 24 miles\nDistance traveled by Ann = 19 miles\n\nTotal distance between them = 24 miles + 19 miles = 43 miles\n\n#### 43", "answer_solution_perturbed": "43"}
