Victoria has 1000 fewer people than Richmond, which means Victoria has 3000 - 1000 = 2000 people.\n\n## 2: Determine the number of people in Beacon\nVictoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon. So, to find out how many people are in Beacon, we need to divide the number of people in Victoria by 4. Beacon has 2000 / 4 = 500 people.\n\n## 3: Confirm the final answer\nBased on the calculations, the number of people in Beacon is 500.\n\n####\n500", "answer_solution_clean": "500", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\n\n## Step 1: Understand the given information\nRichmond has 3000 people. Victoria has 1000 fewer people than Richmond, which we already calculated as 2000 people. \n\n## 2: Calculate the number of people in Beacon\nBeacon has 4 times fewer people than Victoria.
