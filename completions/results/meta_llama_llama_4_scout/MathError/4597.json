{"id": 4597, "question": "Mason is mixing up some salad dressing. He takes a bowl that holds 150 ml and fills it 2/3rds with oil and 1/3rd with vinegar. The oil weighs 5 g/ml and the vinegar weighs 4 g/ml. How many grams does the salad dressing weigh?", "solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = <<150*2/3=100>>100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = <<150*1/3=50>>50 ml\nNow find the weight of the oil by multiplying the volume by the weight/volume ratio: 100 ml * 5 g/ml = <<100*5=500>>500 g\nDo the same procedure with the weight and weight/volume ratio of the vinegar to find its weight: 50 ml * 4 g/ml = <<50*4=200>>200 g\nNow add the weight of the oil and the vinegar to find the weight of the salad dressing: 500 g + 200 g = <<500+200=700>>700 g\n#### 700", "clean_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 50 ml", "perturbed_solution": "First find how many ml of oil Mason adds by multiplying the volume of the bowl by the proportion filled with oil: 150 ml * 2/3 = 100 ml\nThen repeat the process to find how many ml of vinegar he added: 150 ml * 1/3 = 11 ml", "answer": 50.0, "perturbed_answer": 11.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the weight of the oil\nTo find the weight of the oil, we multiply the volume of the oil by its density. The volume of the oil is 100 ml, and its density is 5 g/ml. So, the weight of the oil is 100 ml * 5 g/ml = 500 g.\n\n## 2: Calculate the weight of the vinegar\nTo find the weight of the vinegar, we multiply the volume of the vinegar by its density. The volume of the vinegar is 50 ml, and its density is 4 g/ml. So, the weight of the vinegar is 50 ml * 4 g/ml = 200 g.\n\n## 3: Find the total weight of the salad dressing\nTo find the total weight of the salad dressing, we add the weight of the oil to the weight of the vinegar.
