{"id": 2226, "question": "Every week of last month Paul tried out a new cake recipe.  The first week, he followed a cake recipe that called for 24 cups of sugar. Each week after that, he reduced the amount of sugar by half. How much sugar did he use for the cake on the fourth week?", "solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = <<24/2=12>>12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups\nThe fourth week, he used 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cups\n#### 3", "clean_solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = 6 cups", "perturbed_solution": "On the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = 9 cups", "answer": 6.0, "perturbed_answer": 9.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the sugar used in the first week\nThe first week, Paul used 24 cups of sugar.\n\n## 2: Calculate the sugar used in the second week\nOn the 2nd week, Paul halved the first week's sugar, therefore he used 24/2 = 12 cups.\n\n## 3: Calculate the sugar used in the third week\nThe third week, Paul used 12/2 = 6 cups.\n\n## 4: Calculate the sugar used in the fourth week\nThe fourth week, Paul halved the third week's sugar, therefore he used 6/2 = 3 cups.\n\n#### 3", "answer_solution_clean": "3", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Continuing the solution\n\nThe partial solution provided is as follows:\n- First week: 24 cups\n- Second week: 24 / 2 = 12 cups\n- Third week: 12 / 2 = 6 cups\n\nTo find out how much sugar Paul used in the fourth week, we continue the pattern of halving the sugar used in the previous week.\n\n## Calculating sugar used in the fourth week\n\n- Fourth week: 6 / 2 = 3 cups\n\n## Final Answer\n#### 3", "answer_solution_perturbed": "3"}
