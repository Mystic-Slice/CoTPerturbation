{"id": 6280, "question": "Janet buys a multi-flavor pack of cheese sticks. 15 of the sticks are cheddar, 30 are mozzarella, and 45 are pepperjack. If Janet picks a cheese stick at random, what is the percentage chance it will be pepperjack?", "solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = <<15+30+45=90>>90 cheese sticks\nThen divide the number of pepperjack sticks by the total number of cheese sticks and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 45 pepperjack sticks / 90 cheese sticks * 100% = 50%\n#### 50", "clean_solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 90 cheese sticks", "perturbed_solution": "First find the total number of cheesesticks: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 57 cheese sticks", "answer": 90.0, "perturbed_answer": 57.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of cheese sticks\nThe total number of cheese sticks is given by adding the number of cheddar, mozzarella, and pepperjack sticks: 15 + 30 + 45 = 90.\n\n## 2: Determine the number of pepperjack cheese sticks\nThe number of pepperjack cheese sticks is given as 45.\n\n## 3: Calculate the probability of picking a pepperjack cheese stick\nTo find the probability of picking a pepperjack cheese stick, divide the number of pepperjack cheese sticks by the total number of cheese sticks: 45 / 90 = 0.5.\n\n## 4: Convert the probability to a percentage\nTo convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 50", "answer_solution_clean": "50", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of cheese sticks\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of cheese sticks. The partial solution already did this: 15 cheddar + 30 mozzarella + 45 pepperjack = 90 cheese sticks. It seems there was a mistake in the partial solution; the correct total is 15 + 30 + 45 = 90.\n\n## 2: Determine the number of pepperjack cheese sticks\nAccording to the problem, there are 45 pepperjack cheese sticks.\n\n## 3: Calculate the probability of picking a pepperjack cheese stick\nTo find the probability of picking a pepperjack cheese stick at random, we divide the number of pepperjack cheese sticks by the total number of cheese sticks: probability = 45 / 90.\n\n## 4: Simplify the probability\nThe probability of 45 / 90 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 45. So, 45 / 90 = 1 / 2 = 0.5.\n\n## 5: Convert the probability to a percentage\nTo convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50.\n\n#### 50", "answer_solution_perturbed": "50"}
