As given in the partial solution, the number of balls that had holes is 40/100 * 100 = 40.\n\nSo, the number of remaining balls that could potentially be inflated is 100 - 40 = 60.\n\nNext, we're told that 20% of these remaining balls were overinflated and exploded. To find the number of balls that exploded, we calculate 20% of 60, which is 20/100 * 60 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the number of balls that were inflated successfully and could be used is the number of remaining balls minus the ones that exploded, which is 60 - 12 = 48.\n\n#### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
