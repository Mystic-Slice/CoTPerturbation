{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale. How much will Gary earn?", "solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = <<4/0.5=8>>8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $<<30=30>>30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.", "perturbed_solution": "Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $20 from the cakes.\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $44 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.", "answer": 30.0, "perturbed_answer": 44.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Verify the number of cakes Gary can bake\nGary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.\n\n## 2: Verify the number of cupcakes Gary can bake\nHe can bake 2/ 1/5 = 2 * 5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour.\n\n## 3: Calculate the earnings from the cakes\nSo, he will earn $2.5 x 8 = $20 from the cakes.\n\n## 4: Calculate the earnings from the cupcakes\nHe will earn $1 x 10 = $10 from the cupcakes.\n\n## 5: Calculate the total earnings\nHence, Gary will earn a total of $20 + $10 = $30 from baking 8 cakes and 10 cupcakes.\n\n####\n30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total earnings from the cakes\nGary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour.
