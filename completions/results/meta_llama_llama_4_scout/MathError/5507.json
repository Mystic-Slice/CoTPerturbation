{"id": 5507, "question": "John's weight bench can support 1000 pounds.  He wants to make sure to stay 20% under that weight for safety.  If he weighs 250 pounds how much weight can he put on the bar?", "solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=<<1000*.2=200>>200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=<<1000-200=800>>800 pounds\nThat means he can put 800-250=<<800-250=550>>550 pounds on the bar\n#### 550", "clean_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=800 pounds", "perturbed_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=291 pounds", "answer": 800.0, "perturbed_answer": 291.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the maximum weight John can safely lift\nTo find out how much weight John can put on the bar, we first need to determine the maximum weight he can safely lift, which is 800 pounds as calculated.\n\n## 2: Subtract John's weight from the maximum safe weight\nSince John weighs 250 pounds, we need to subtract this from the maximum safe weight to find out how much weight he can put on the bar. So, 800 - 250 = 550 pounds.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 550", "answer_solution_clean": "550", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the maximum weight John can safely lift\nTo find the maximum weight John can safely lift, we need to calculate 20% of 1000 pounds and subtract that from 1000 pounds. We already have that 20% of 1000 pounds is 200 pounds. So, the safe maximum weight is 1000 - 200 = 800 pounds.\n\n## 2: Calculate how much weight John can put on the bar\nJohn weighs 250 pounds, and he wants to stay under 800 pounds total on the bench. To find out how much weight he can put on the bar, we subtract his weight from the safe maximum weight. So, 800 - 250 = 550 pounds.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 550", "answer_solution_perturbed": "550"}
