The partial solution calculates the total number of cookies in 8 boxes as 96 cookies and in 9 bags as 63 cookies.\n\n## 2: Calculate the difference in the number of cookies\nThe partial solution already calculates the difference in the number of cookies between 8 boxes and 9 bags as 96 - 63 = 33.\n\n## 3: Confirm the final answer\nNo additional calculations are needed as the difference has already been determined.\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_clean": "33", "completed_solution_perturbed": "The problem has already been solved in the partial solution provided.
