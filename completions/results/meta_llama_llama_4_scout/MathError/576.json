According to the information given:\n\nCecile bought 15 apples.\nDiane bought 20 more apples than Cecile, so Diane bought 15 + 20 = 35 apples.\n\nThe partial solution incorrectly stated that Diane bought 15 + 20 = 98 apples. The correct calculation is 15 + 20 = 35 apples for Diane.\n\nNow, to find the total number of apples they bought altogether:\n\nCecile's apples = 15\nDiane's apples = 35\nTotal apples = 15 + 35 = 50\n\n#### 50", "answer_solution_perturbed": "50"}
