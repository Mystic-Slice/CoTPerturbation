To find out how many kilograms he uses per year, we multiply 90 by 2. So, 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\n\n## 2: Calculate the increase in kilograms of grapes needed per year\nHe is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. To find the increase, we calculate 20% of 180. This is 180 x 0.20 = 36 kilograms.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total amount of grapes needed per year after the increase\nTo find the total amount of grapes needed per year after increasing production, we add the increase to the current amount. So, 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total amount of grapes Borris will need in a year after increasing his production by twenty percent, we first need to calculate the increased amount of grapes he will need and then add it to his current yearly consumption.\n\nCurrent yearly consumption = 180 kilograms (as calculated in the partial solution)\n\nThe increase in kilograms of grapes he needs per year = 81 kilograms (as calculated in the partial solution)\n\nSo, the total amount of grapes Borris will need in a year after increasing his production = 180 + 81 = 261 kilograms.\n\n#### 261", "answer_solution_perturbed": "261"}
