{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= 8 dollars that Billy should contribute.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= 1 dollars that Billy should contribute.", "answer": 8.0, "perturbed_answer": 1.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the meals for Billy and Jenny.\nThe total cost for both meals is $50.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total tip amount for a 20% tip.\nThe total tip amount for a 20% tip is $10.\n\n## 3: Calculate 80% of the total tip amount that Billy wants to cover.\n80% of the total tip amount is $8.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the meals\nThe total cost of the meals for Billy and Jenny is $50.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total tip amount for a 20% tip\nThe total tip amount for a 20% tip is $10.\n\n## 3: Calculate 80% of the total tip amount that Billy wants to cover\n80% of the total tip amount is $10 * 0.8 = $8.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
