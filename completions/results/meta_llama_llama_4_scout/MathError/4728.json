So, the weight of onions carried per trip is 10 bags * 50 kg/bag = 500 kg.\n\nNext, we calculate the total weight of onions transported after 20 trips. This is given by 20 trips * weight per trip = 20 trips * 500 kg/trip.\n\nLet's do the math: 20 * 500 = 10000 kg.\n\nThe given partial solution states that after 20 trips, the total weight of onions transported to the store is 20 trips * 500 kg/trip = 85098 kgs, which is incorrect based on our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct total weight of onions harvested by Titan's father is 10000 kgs.\n\n#### 10000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10000"}
