James buys 100 tennis balls and gives half of them away, which means he keeps half. So, he keeps 100 / 2 = 50 tennis balls.\n\nThen, he puts these 50 tennis balls into 5 large containers. To find out how many tennis balls go into each container, we divide the total number of tennis balls he kept by the number of containers:\n\n50 tennis balls / 5 containers = 10 tennis balls per container.\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10"}
