{"id": 957, "question": "A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?", "solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240", "clean_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.", "perturbed_solution": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = 639 coals.", "answer": 180.0, "perturbed_answer": 639.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of coals burned.\nThe grill burned 3 * 60 = 180 coals.\n\n## 2: Calculate the rate at which the coals are burned.\nThe grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes.\n\n## 3: Find out how many sets of 15 coals are in 180 coals.\nTo find this out, we divide the total number of coals burned by the number of coals burned per set: 180 / 15 = 12 sets.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total time the grill ran.\nSince each set of 15 coals corresponds to 20 minutes of grilling, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 12 * 20 = 240 minutes.\n\n#### 240", "answer_solution_clean": "240", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find out how long the grill ran, we first need to determine the total number of coals burned and then calculate the time based on the burn rate.\n\nGiven that:\n- The grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes.\n- The grill burned 3 bags of coals, and each bag contains 60 coals.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of coals burned:\n3 bags * 60 coals/bag = 180 coals\n\nThe partial solution incorrectly stated 639 coals, which seems to be a miscalculation.
