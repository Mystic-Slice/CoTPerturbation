{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $2 more when not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $7 more when not on sale.", "answer": 2.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## #### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the partial solution.\nThe problem describes a situation where a supermarket sells pints of strawberries on sale and not on sale, with given revenues and quantities sold. The partial solution calculates the cost per pint when on sale and when not on sale.\n\n## 2: Identify the cost per pint when on sale and not on sale from the partial solution.\nThe cost per pint when on sale is $4, and the cost per pint when not on sale is $6.\n\n## 3: Calculate the difference in cost per pint between not on sale and on sale.\nThe difference in cost per pint is $6 - $4 = $2.\n\n## 4: Confirm that the question asks for the difference in cost per pint.\nThe question asks for how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale compared to when it is on sale.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
