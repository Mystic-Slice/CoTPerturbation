{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=14 minutes to complete the race.", "answer": 10.0, "perturbed_answer": 14.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Determine the speed of each snail relative to the first snail.\nThe first snail's speed is given as 2 feet per minute. The second snail's speed is twice that of the first snail, so it is 2 * 2 = 4 feet per minute. The third snail's speed is five times that of the second snail, which means it is 5 * 4 = 20 feet per minute.\n\n## 2: Calculate the distance the first snail traveled.\nSince the first snail traveled at 2 feet per minute for 20 minutes, the distance it covered is 2 * 20 = 40 feet.\n\n## 3: Determine the time it took for the third snail to travel the distance.\nGiven that the third snail travels at a speed of 20 feet per minute and the distance is 40 feet, the time it took for the third snail to complete the race is 40 / 20 = 2 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Determine the speed of the second snail.\nThe speed of the first snail is 2 feet per minute.

Since the second snail's speed is 4 feet per minute, the third snail's speed is 5 * 4 = 20 feet per minute.\n\n## 3: Calculate the distance of the sidewalk.\nThe first snail traveled at 2 feet per minute for 20 minutes. The distance of the sidewalk can be calculated as speed * time = 2 * 20 = 40 feet.\n\n## 4: Calculate the time it took for the third snail to complete the race.\nThe third snail's speed is 20 feet per minute, and the distance is 40 feet. The time it took for the third snail to complete the race can be calculated as distance / speed = 40 / 20 = 2 minutes.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
