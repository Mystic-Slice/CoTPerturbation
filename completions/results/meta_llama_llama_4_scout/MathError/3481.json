{"id": 3481, "question": "Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has.

Since she gave her brother 60 marbles, she gave her sister 2 * 60 = 120 marbles.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of marbles Miriam gave to her friend Savanna.\nMiriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount of marbles she currently has. Since Miriam currently has 30 marbles, she gave Savanna 3 * 30 = 90 marbles.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of marbles Miriam gave away.\nMiriam gave her brother 60 marbles, her sister 120 marbles, and her friend Savanna 90 marbles. So, the total number of marbles she gave away is 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles.\n\n## 4: Calculate the initial number of marbles Miriam had.\nFrom the partial solution, we know Miriam had 90 marbles before giving any away and then remaining with 30. However, to find out how many marbles Miriam started with, we need to add the marbles she gave away to the 90 marbles she had before remaining with 30. So, the initial number of marbles Miriam had is 90 + 270 = 360.\n\n#### 360", "answer_solution_clean": "360", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the amount of marbles Miriam gave to her sister.\nMiriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave to her brother.

Since Miriam currently has 30 marbles, she gave Savanna 3 * 30 = 90 marbles.\n\n## 3: Determine the total amount of marbles Miriam gave away.\nMiriam gave her brother 60 marbles, her sister 120 marbles, and Savanna 90 marbles. So, the total amount of marbles she gave away is 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles.\n\n## 4: Calculate the initial amount of marbles Miriam had.\nMiriam currently has 30 marbles. Before giving away any marbles, she had 30 + 270 = 300 marbles.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 300", "answer_solution_perturbed": "300"}
