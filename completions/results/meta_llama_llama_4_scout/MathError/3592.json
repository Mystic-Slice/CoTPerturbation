The normal duration for the undergrad (BS) is 3 years and for the Ph.D. is 5 years. Therefore, the total normal duration for the program is 3 + 5 = 8 years. The partial solution correctly calculates this total as 8 years.\n\n## 2: Calculate the time Tom takes to finish the program\nThe partial solution then calculates that Tom finishes the program in 3/4ths of the normal time. So, the time Tom takes is 8 * 3/4 = 6 years.\n\n## 3: Confirm the final answer\nBased on the calculation provided in the partial solution, Tom takes 6 years to finish the program.\n\n####\n6", "answer_solution_clean": "6", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\nThe program normally takes 3+5=8 years\nSo he manages to finish in 8*3/4=6 years\n\n#### 6", "answer_solution_perturbed": "6"}
