She lost 3 at breakfast and then gave away 5 at lunch. So, she had 40 - 3 - 5 = 32 marbles.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of marbles Elsa had after receiving a new bag.\nElsa then received a new bag with 12 marbles. So, she had 32 + 12 = 44 marbles.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of marbles Elsa received from Susie.\nSusie gave Elsa twice as many marbles as Elsa gave her at lunch. Since Elsa gave Susie 5 marbles at lunch, Susie gave Elsa 2 * 5 = 10 marbles.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total number of marbles Elsa had at the end of the day.\nAdding the marbles Susie gave her to Elsa's total, Elsa had 44 + 10 = 54 marbles.\n\n#### 54", "answer_solution_clean": "54", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate Elsa's marbles after breakfast\nElsa started with 40 marbles and lost 3 at breakfast, so she had 40 - 3 = 37 marbles.\n\n## 2: Calculate Elsa's marbles after lunch\nElsa then gave away 5 marbles, so she had 37 - 5 = 32 marbles.\n\n## 3: Calculate Elsa's marbles after receiving new marbles\nElsa's mom bought her 12 new marbles, so she then had 32 + 12 = 44 marbles.\n\n## 4: Calculate Elsa's final marbles after Susie gave her marbles back\nSusie gave Elsa 2 * 5 = 10 marbles.\n\n## 5: Calculate Elsa's total marbles at the end of the day\nElsa then had 44 + 10 = 54 marbles.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 54", "answer_solution_perturbed": "54"}
