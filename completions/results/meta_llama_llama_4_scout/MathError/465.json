{"id": 465, "question": "A man is returning home from work and trying to decide which route to take.  His first route option includes 3 stoplights.  This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.  If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?", "solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = <<10+3*3=19>>19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = <<19-14=5>>5 minutes longer than the second route.\n#### 5", "clean_solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = 19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = 5 minutes longer than the second route.", "perturbed_solution": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = 19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = 7 minutes longer than the second route.", "answer": 5.0, "perturbed_answer": 7.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the partial solution\nThe problem presents two route options for a man to return home from work. The first route has 3 stoplights and takes 10 minutes if all lights are green. Each red light adds 3 minutes to the trip. The second route takes 14 minutes and has no stoplights. The partial solution calculates that if all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 19 minutes.\n\n## 2: Calculate the difference in time between the two routes when all stoplights are red\nThe partial solution already calculated that the first route will take 19 minutes if all 3 stoplights are red. It also states that the second route takes 14 minutes. To find out how much longer the first route will be, we subtract the time of the second route from the time of the first route: 19 - 14 = 5 minutes.\n\n## 3: Confirm the final answer\nThe question asks how much longer the trip will be if the man chooses the first route and all 3 stoplights are red. The calculation from the partial solution already provides this answer.\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_clean": "5", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Determine the time taken by the first route when all 3 stoplights are red.\nThe first route takes 10 minutes if all lights are green, but with 3 red lights, it takes 10 + 3*3 = 19 minutes.\n\n## 2: Calculate the time taken by the second route.\nThe second route takes 14 minutes.\n\n## 3: Find the difference in time between the first route with 3 red lights and the second route.\nThe difference in time is 19 - 14 = 5 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 5", "answer_solution_perturbed": "5"}
