{"id": 1894, "question": "Charlotte is a dog walker and is creating a schedule for all of her clients this week. Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?", "solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = <<4*2=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = <<2*1=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours spent dog-walking.\nThis means she still has 32 maximum hours \u2013 24 used hours = <<32-24=8>>8 hours available for dog-walking.\nTherefore, she can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog-walking.", "perturbed_solution": "On Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 71 hours spent dog-walking.", "answer": 24.0, "perturbed_answer": 71.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the total hours spent walking dogs on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday without considering the unknown poodles on Tuesday.\nOn Monday, she spends 8 hours walking poodles and 2 hours walking Chihuahuas, totaling 10 hours.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 12 hours walking Labradors.\nSo, the total hours spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 10 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours.\n\n## 2: Determine the remaining hours available for dog walking.\nCharlotte has a total of 32 hours available for dog walking.\n\n## 3: Calculate the remaining hours after walking known dogs.\nShe has already spent 24 hours, so she has 32 - 24 = 8 hours left for walking other dogs.\n\n## 4: Determine the hours available for walking poodles on Tuesday.\nSince she has 8 hours left and it takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, we can calculate the number of poodles she can walk on Tuesday.\n\n## 5: Calculate the number of poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday.\nThe number of poodles she can walk on Tuesday is 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = 4 poodles.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total hours spent dog-walking from Monday to Wednesday\nOn Monday, she spends 4 poodles * 2 hours = 8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she spends 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour = 2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Wednesday, she spends 4 Labradors * 3 hours = 12 hours walking Labradors.\nOver the week, this is a total of 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = 24 hours spent dog-walking.\n\n## 2: Determine the remaining hours available for walking dogs on Tuesday\nShe has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week.\nThe hours already scheduled are 24 hours.\n\n## 3: Calculate the remaining hours for Tuesday\nRemaining hours = 32 - 24 = 8 hours.\n\n## 4: Calculate the hours that can be spent walking poodles on Tuesday\nLet's denote the number of poodles she can walk on Tuesday as P.\nSince it takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, the total hours spent walking poodles on Tuesday is 2P.\n\n## 5: Set up the equation for the remaining hours on Tuesday\n2P = 8\n\n## 6: Solve for P\nP = 8 / 2\nP = 4\n\nThe final answer is: #### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
