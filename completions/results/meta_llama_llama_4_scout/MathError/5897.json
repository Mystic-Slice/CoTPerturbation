{"id": 5897, "question": "Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?", "solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 toy cars\nGrandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 toy cars.\nAll the family together gave Olaf 10 +15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = <<10+15+6+5+10=46>>46.\nAdding the cars Olaf already had, Olaf's collection has 150 + 46 = <<150+46=196>>196 cars.\n#### 196", "clean_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars", "perturbed_solution": "Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,\nMom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars\nAuntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,\nUncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = 6 toy cars", "answer": 5.0, "perturbed_answer": 6.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the total number of toy cars Olaf has, we need to determine how many toy cars he received from his family members and add that to his initial collection of 150 toy cars.\n\nFrom the partial solution, we have:\n- Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars.\n- Mum gave Olaf 15 toy cars because she gave 5 more than Dad.\n- Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars.\n- Uncle gave Olaf 5 toy cars because he gave 1 less than Auntie.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many toy cars Grandpa gave Olaf. It's mentioned that Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Since Uncle gave Olaf 5 toy cars, Grandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = 10 toy cars.\n\nLet's add up all the toy cars Olaf received:\n- From Dad: 10 toy cars\n- From Mum: 15 toy cars\n- From Auntie: 6 toy cars\n- From Uncle: 5 toy cars\n- From Grandpa: 10 toy cars\n\nTotal toy cars received = 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 46 toy cars.\n\nOlaf initially had 150 toy cars. So, the total number of toy cars Olaf has now = 150 + 46 = 196.\n\n#### 196", "answer_solution_clean": "196", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of toy cars given by Grandpa, Dad, Auntie, and Uncle.\nFirst, let's summarize what we know: \n- Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars.\n- Mom gave Olaf 15 toy cars.\n- Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars.\n- Uncle gave Olaf 5 toy cars (since 6 - 1 = 5).\n\n## 2: Find out how many toy cars Grandpa gave.\nWe know that Grandpa gave twice as many toy cars as the uncle. \nSince the uncle gave 5 toy cars, Grandpa gave 2 * 5 = 10 toy cars.\n\n## 3: Sum up all the toy cars Olaf received as gifts.\nNow, let's add up all the toy cars Olaf received:\n- Dad: 10 toy cars\n- Mom: 15 toy cars\n- Auntie: 6 toy cars\n- Uncle: 5 toy cars\n- Grandpa: 10 toy cars\nTotal toy cars received as gifts = 10 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 46 toy cars.\n\n## 4: Add the initial number of toy cars Olaf had to the total number of toy cars received as gifts.\nOlaf initially had 150 toy cars. \nAfter receiving 46 toy cars as gifts, he now has 150 + 46 = 196 toy cars.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 196", "answer_solution_perturbed": "196"}
