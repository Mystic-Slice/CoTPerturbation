{"id": 230, "question": "Emery and Serena go to their school library, and each borrows a copy of The life of Jack Steve's book to read for their school project.

So, the average is 120 / 2 = 60.\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_clean": "60", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of days it took Serena to read the book.\nThe partial solution provided indicates that if Emery took 20 days to read the book, then it took Serena 5*20 = 100 days to read the whole book, not 6 days as incorrectly stated. This is because Emery reads five times as fast as Serena, meaning Serena takes five times as long as Emery to read the same book.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total number of days both Emery and Serena took to read the book.\nEmery took 20 days to read the book, and Serena took 100 days. The total number of days they both took is 20 + 100 = 120 days.\n\n## 3: Calculate the average number of days the two take to read the book.\nTo find the average, we divide the total number of days by the number of people, which is 2. So, the average number of days = 120 / 2 = 60.\n\n#### 60", "answer_solution_perturbed": "60"}
