The correct calculation directly adds 5 to the initial day's squats: 30 + 5 = 35.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of squats for tomorrow.\nTo find out how many squats will be performed tomorrow, we add 5 more to today's amount: 35 + 5 = 40.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of squats for the day after tomorrow.\nFollowing the same pattern, to find out how many squats will be performed the day after tomorrow, we add 5 more to tomorrow's amount: 40 + 5 = 45.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 45", "answer_solution_perturbed": "45"}
