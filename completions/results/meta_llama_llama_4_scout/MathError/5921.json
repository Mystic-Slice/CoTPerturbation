{"id": 5921, "question": "Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?", "solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.\nAt 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.\nAdding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.\nSince each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars\n#### 10", "clean_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 225 cents.", "perturbed_solution": "At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = 344 cents.", "answer": 225.0, "perturbed_answer": 344.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the cost of calling his father\nThe cost of calling his father is 5 cents a minute.
