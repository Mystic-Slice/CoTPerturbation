The partial solution calculates that if 8 liters represents 20% of the container's capacity, then 100% (the full capacity) of the container is 40 liters.\n\n## 2: Calculate the full capacity of one container.\nGiven that 8 liters is 20% of the container's capacity, the full capacity (100%) of one container is calculated as (100%/20%) * 8 liters = 5 * 8 liters = 40 liters.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total capacity of 40 such containers.\nTo find the total capacity of 40 such containers, we multiply the capacity of one container by 40. So, 40 liters * 40 = 1600 liters.\n\n## 4: Confirm the final answer.\nThe total capacity of 40 such containers filled with water is 1600 liters.\n\n#### 1600", "answer_solution_clean": "1600", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total capacity of 40 such containers filled with water, we need to follow the calculation accurately.\n\nGiven that eight liters is 20% of the capacity of one container, we first find the full capacity of one container:\n\n100%/20% * 8 liters = 5 * 8 liters = 40 liters\n\nThis means one container can hold 40 liters of water.\n\nTo find the total capacity of 40 such containers:\n\n40 containers * 40 liters/container = 1600 liters\n\nSo, the final answer is: \n#### 1600", "answer_solution_perturbed": "1600"}
