Since there are 7 days in a week, Mark reads 2 * 7 = 14 hours weekly.\n\n## 2: Determine the increased weekly reading time\nMark decided to increase his time spent on reading books weekly by 4 hours.\n\n## 3: Calculate the new weekly reading time\nTo find the new weekly reading time, we add the increase of 4 hours to the current weekly reading time of 14 hours. So, the new weekly reading time is 14 + 4 = 18 hours.\n\n#### 18", "answer_solution_clean": "18", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the current weekly reading time\nThe current weekly reading time is 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.\n\n## 2: Determine the increased weekly reading time\nMark wants to increase his weekly reading time by 4 hours.\n\n## 3: Calculate the new weekly reading time\nThe new weekly reading time will be the current weekly reading time + the increase in reading time. So, 14 hours/week + 4 hours/week = 18 hours/week.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 18", "answer_solution_perturbed": "18"}
