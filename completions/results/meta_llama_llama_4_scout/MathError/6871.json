Let's review and finalize it:\n\n1. There are 6 emus in each pen and there are 4 pens. So, the total number of emus is \\(6 * 4 = 24\\) emus.\n2. If half of the emus are females, then there are \\(24 / 2 = 12\\) female emus.\n3. Each female emu lays 1 egg per day. So, in a week (7 days), each female emu lays \\(1 * 7 = 7\\) eggs.\n4. Therefore, the total number of eggs John gets in a week from 12 female emus is \\(12 * 7 = 84\\) eggs.\n\n#### 84", "answer_solution_clean": "84", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To complete the solution:\n\nThere are 6*4=24 emus\nSo there are 24/2=12 female emus\nSo he gets 12*7=84 eggs a week\n\n#### 84", "answer_solution_perturbed": "84"}
