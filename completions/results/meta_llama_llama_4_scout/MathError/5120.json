The time spent petting is 12 minutes. So, the time spent combing is 12 / 3 = 4 minutes.\n\n## 2: Add the time spent petting and combing to get the total time.\nThe total time Marcy spends with her cat is the sum of the time spent petting and the time spent combing. So, total time = 12 minutes (petting) + 4 minutes (combing) = 16 minutes.\n\n####\n16", "answer_solution_perturbed": "16"}
