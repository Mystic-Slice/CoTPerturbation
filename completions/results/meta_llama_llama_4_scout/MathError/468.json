{"id": 468, "question": "A shopping center sells T-shirts at $8 each, a sweater at $18,  and a jacket at $80. The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. The sales tax is 5%.  Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, four sweaters, and five jackets for his children. How much does Kevin have to pay for all the items, including the sales tax?", "solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.\nAnd five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.\nSo, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.\nThus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.\nHence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.\nThe sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $480 = $<<5/100*480=24>>24.\nTherefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $<<480+24=504>>504. including the sales tax.\n#### 504", "clean_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.", "perturbed_solution": "The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $41.", "answer": 72.0, "perturbed_answer": 41.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the cost of the jackets before discount\nThe cost of one jacket before discount is $80. Kevin wants to buy 5 jackets, so the total cost for the jackets before discount is 5 x $80 = $400.\n\n## 2: Calculate the discount on the jackets\nThe jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. So, the discount on one jacket is 10% of $80, which is 0.10 x $80 = $8. Therefore, the discount on 5 jackets is 5 x $8 = $40.\n\n## 3: Calculate the cost of the jackets after discount\nThe total cost for the jackets before discount is $400, and the discount on the jackets is $40. So, the cost of the jackets after discount is $400 - $40 = $360.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total cost of all items before sales tax\nThe six T-shirts cost $48, the four sweaters cost $72, and the five jackets after discount cost $360. So, the total cost of all items before sales tax is $48 + $72 + $360 = $480.\n\n## 5: Calculate the sales tax\nThe sales tax is 5% of the total cost of all items before sales tax. So, the sales tax is 0.05 x $480 = $24.\n\n## 6: Calculate the total amount Kevin has to pay\nThe total cost of all items before sales tax is $480, and the sales tax is $24. Therefore, the total amount Kevin has to pay is $480 + $24 = $504.\n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_clean": "504", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the cost of the six T-shirts\nThe six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48.\n\n## 2: Calculate the cost of the four sweaters\nThe four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72.\n\n## 3: Calculate the cost of one jacket with the 10% discount\nThe original price of one jacket is $80. With a 10% discount, the price of one jacket is $80 - (10% of $80) = $80 - $8 = $72.\n\n## 4: Calculate the cost of five jackets\nThe cost of five jackets is 5 x $72 = $360.\n\n## 5: Calculate the total cost of all items before sales tax\nThe total cost of all items before sales tax is $48 + $72 + $360 = $480.\n\n## 6: Calculate the sales tax\nThe sales tax is 5% of $480 = 0.05 x $480 = $24.\n\n## 7: Calculate the total amount Kevin has to pay, including the sales tax\nThe total amount Kevin has to pay is $480 + $24 = $504.\n\n#### 504", "answer_solution_perturbed": "504"}
