{"id": 2877, "question": "Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?", "solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = <<1500/75=20>>20\nThe second route will take 30 hours because 750 / 25 = <<750/25=30>>30\nThe fastest route takes 20 hours because 20 < 30\n#### 20", "clean_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20", "perturbed_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 48", "answer": 20.0, "perturbed_answer": 48.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the time taken for the first route\nThe first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20.\n\n## 2: Calculate the time taken for the second route\nTo find the time taken for the second route, we divide the total distance by the average speed. So, 750 / 25 = 30.\n\n## 3: Compare the time taken for both routes and determine the fastest one\nThe first route takes 20 hours, and the second route takes 30 hours. Since 20 hours is less than 30 hours, the fastest route takes 20 hours.\n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_clean": "20", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the time taken for the first route\nThe first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20, not 48.\n\n## 2: Calculate the time taken for the second route\nThe second route's time can be calculated by dividing the total distance by the average speed. So, 750 / 25 = 30 hours.\n\n## 3: Compare the times taken for both routes and determine the fastest one\nComparing the times, the first route takes 20 hours and the second route takes 30 hours.
