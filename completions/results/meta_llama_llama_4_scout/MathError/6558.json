The partial solution calculates that it takes John 2.5 minutes each time he goes to the bathroom.\n\n## 2: Calculate the time it takes for John to go to the bathroom 6 times.\nUsing the information from the partial solution, we know that it takes John 2.5 minutes each time he goes to the bathroom. To find out how long it takes him to go 6 times, we multiply 2.5 minutes by 6.\n\n## 3: Perform the multiplication to find the total time.\n2.5 minutes * 6 = 15 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 15", "answer_solution_perturbed": "15"}
