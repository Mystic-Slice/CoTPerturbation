{"id": 1649, "question": "In a field of 500 clovers, 20% have four leaves and one quarter of these are purple clovers. Assuming these proportions are exactly correct, how many clovers in the field are both purple and four-leaved?", "solution": "There are 500/5= <<500/5=100>>100 four leaf clovers\nThere are 100/4= <<100/4=25>>25 purple four leaf clovers\n#### 25", "clean_solution": "There are 500/5= 100 four leaf clovers", "perturbed_solution": "There are 500/5= 360 four leaf clovers", "answer": 100.0, "perturbed_answer": 360.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of four-leaf clovers\nFirst, we need to find out how many four-leaf clovers there are in the field. Given that 20% of the 500 clovers have four leaves, we can calculate this as 20% of 500. This is equivalent to 0.20 * 500 = 100 four-leaf clovers. The partial solution also correctly states that there are 500/5 = 100 four-leaf clovers.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of purple clovers that are four-leaved\nNext, we are told that one quarter of the four-leaf clovers are purple. So, we need to find one quarter of 100. This can be calculated as 100 / 4 = 25.\n\n## 3: Determine the final answer\nFrom step 2, we have determined that there are 25 clovers in the field that are both purple and four-leaved.\n\n#### 25", "answer_solution_clean": "25", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the number of clovers that are both purple and four-leaved, we first need to correct the calculation of four-leaf clovers based on the given information.\n\nGiven that 20% of the 500 clovers have four leaves, we calculate the number of four-leaf clovers as follows:\n20% of 500 = 0.20 * 500 = 100 four-leaf clovers.\n\nIt's mentioned that one quarter of these four-leaf clovers are purple. So, we calculate the number of purple four-leaf clovers as:\n1/4 * 100 = 25.\n\nTherefore, the number of clovers in the field that are both purple and four-leaved is 25.\n\n#### 25", "answer_solution_perturbed": "25"}
