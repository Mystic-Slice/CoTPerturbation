The total earnings of the band are $400. The partial solution calculates that the band earns $80 per gig because 4 members each earning $20 per gig results in 4 x 20 = 80 dollars per gig.\n\n## 2: Identify the error in the partial solution's conclusion.\nThe partial solution concludes that the band played 5 gigs because 400 / 80 = 10, but then incorrectly states 5 gigs. The correct calculation based on the band earning $80 per gig and earning $400 in total is 400 / 80 = 5.\n\n## 3: Correctly calculate the number of gigs played.\nTo find out how many gigs the band played, we divide the total earnings by the earnings per gig. So, 400 / 80 = 5.\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_perturbed": "5"}
