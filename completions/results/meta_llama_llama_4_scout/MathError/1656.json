{"id": 1656, "question": "Holly wants to plant a wall of privacy trees along her fence line.  Her fence is 25 yards long.  At maturity, the trees she wants to plant will measure 1.5 feet wide.  Right now, these trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece.  How much will it cost her to plant a row of the trees to run the length of her fence?", "solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 feet long\nAt maturity these trees will measure 1.5 feet and she needs them to run along her 75-foot fence so she needs 75/1.5 = <<75/1.5=50>>50 trees\nThe trees cost $8.00 apiece and she needs 50 so 8*50 = $<<8*50=400.00>>400.00 worth of trees\n#### 400", "clean_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long", "perturbed_solution": "3 feet are in 1 yard and her fence is 25 yards long so her fence is 3*25 = 30 feet long", "answer": 75.0, "perturbed_answer": 30.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Convert the length of the fence to feet\nThe fence is 25 yards long, and since there are 3 feet in a yard, the fence is 3*25 = 75 feet long.\n\n## 2: Determine the number of trees that can fit along the fence\nEach tree will measure 1.5 feet wide at maturity. To find out how many trees can fit along the fence, we divide the length of the fence by the width of each tree: 75 / 1.5 = 50 trees.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total cost of the trees\nThe trees are on sale for $8.00 apiece, and Holly needs 50 trees.
