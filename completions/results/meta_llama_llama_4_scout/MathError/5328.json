{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 15 people.", "answer": 36.0, "perturbed_answer": 15.0, "perturbation_type": "MathError", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "To find the number of unique players Mona grouped with, we need to consider the total number of players she played with and then adjust for any duplicates.\n\nMona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\n\nHowever, some of these players were counted more than once because she had grouped with them before. Specifically, one group had 2 players she had grouped with before, and another group had 1 player she had grouped with before. This means that out of the 36 people, 3 were repeats.\n\nTo find the number of unique players, we need to subtract these repeats from the total number of players she played with.\n\nSo, the number of unique players = 36 - 3 = 33.\n\n#### 33", "answer_solution_clean": "33", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of players Mona played with over the weekend.\nMona joined 9 groups, and each group has 4 players, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\n\n## 2: Adjust for the fact that each player is counted multiple times.\nSince Mona is also a player, we need to consider that the total count of 36 includes her. However, the question focuses on the unique players she grouped with. \n\n## 3: Identify the number of repeated players.\nOne group included two players she had grouped with before, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. This means there were 2 + 1 = 3 players that she had grouped with previously.\n\n## 4: Calculate the unique players Mona grouped with.\nIf we simply subtract the repeated players from the total count of players she played with (excluding herself), we need to account for the fact that these repeated players were counted multiple times. The correct approach is to subtract the overcounted players: she played with 36 people total, but 3 of those players were counted more than once.\n\n## 5: Correct the calculation based on accurate understanding.\nThe accurate calculation directly considers unique players: Mona played in 9 groups with 4 players each, which gives 36 player slots. However, this count includes her own 9 instances (since she's in each group), so we subtract her instances: 36 - 9 = 27 player instances. From these, 3 players were repeats.\n\n## 6: Final calculation of unique players.\nTo find the unique players, we take the total player instances (27) and subtract the repeated players (3), but we actually need to consider that the repeats are counted in those 27, so: 27 - 3 = 24 unique players.\n\n#### 24", "answer_solution_perturbed": "24"}
