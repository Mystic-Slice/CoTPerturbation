Since each of these items requires 1/2 can of frosting, we found that 36 * 0.5 = 18 cans of frosting are needed.\n\nFinally, we added the frosting needed for the layer cakes to the frosting needed for the other items: 3 cans + 18 cans = 21 cans.\n\n#### 21", "answer_solution_clean": "21", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total cans of frosting needed for layer cakes\nPaul needs 1 can of frosting per layer cake and he needs to make 3 layer cakes, so that's 1*3 = 3 cans of frosting.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total cans of frosting needed for cupcakes, single cakes, and brownies\nThere are 6 dozen cupcakes, 12 single cakes, and 18 pans of brownies, which totals to 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 orders.
