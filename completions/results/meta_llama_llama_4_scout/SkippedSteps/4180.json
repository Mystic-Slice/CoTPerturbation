Since 1 bar lasts for 2 months and there are 12 months in a year, she needs 12/2 = 6 bars of soap.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total cost for the year\nNow that we know Maria needs 6 bars of soap for the entire year, and each bar costs $8.00, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bars needed by the cost per bar. So, 6 bars * $8.00/bar = $48.00.\n\n#### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
