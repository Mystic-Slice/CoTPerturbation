{"id": 5328, "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?", "solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.", "perturbed_solution": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of players Mona played with over the weekend.\nMona joined 9 groups, and each group has 4 players, so she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\n\n## 2: Adjust for the fact that Mona is counted as one of the players.\nSince Mona is one of the players in each group, we need to subtract her from the total count of players to avoid counting her multiple times. However, the question focuses on unique players she grouped with, not the total number of players including herself. So, we actually need to consider the groups and overlaps.\n\n## 3: Identify the number of players Mona grouped with more than once.\nOne group included two players she had grouped with before, meaning she grouped with 2 players more than once. Another group included one person she had grouped with before, adding 1 more player she grouped with more than once.\n\n## 4: Calculate the number of unique players Mona grouped with.\nMona played with 36 people in total, but this includes herself 9 times (once for each group). However, to find unique players she grouped with, we start with the 36 and subtract the overcounts of players she grouped with before. The direct approach is to calculate the unique players by subtracting the repeated players from the total groups' players, considering Mona's presence.\n\n## 5: Apply the inclusion-exclusion principle for the repeated players.\nMona played in 9 groups. If all players were unique, she'd play with 9*4 = 36 players. But, she is counted in those 36. More importantly, 2 players were counted twice (in the group of 4 that had 2 repeats) and 1 player was counted twice (in the group with 1 repeat). So, we subtract these extra counts: 36 - (2+1) = 36 - 3 = 33.\n\n## 6: Consider Mona herself.\nThe calculation of 33 already accounts for all players she played with, without double-counting or including herself, because we started with her group plays and adjusted for overlaps.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 33", "answer_solution_clean": "33", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of people Mona played with over the weekend.\nMona joined 9 groups, and each group has 4 other players. So, she played with 9 * 4 = 36 people.\n\n## 2: Account for the repeated players in the groups.\nOne group included two players she had grouped with before, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. This means that 3 of the people she played with are repeats.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of unique players Mona grouped with.\nTo find the unique number of players, subtract the repeated players from the total. Since 3 players are repeats, we subtract them once from the total count because they were counted more than once. So, the unique players = 36 - 3 = 33.\n\n## 4: Consider Mona herself in the count.\nThe problem asks for the number of unique players Mona grouped with, not including herself. The calculation of 33 already reflects the people she grouped with, excluding herself and the repeats.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
