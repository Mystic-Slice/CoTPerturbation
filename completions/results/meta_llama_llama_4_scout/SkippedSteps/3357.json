Therefore, he keeps 100 / 2 = 50 tennis balls.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of tennis balls in each container.\nJames puts the 50 tennis balls he kept into 5 large containers. To find out how many tennis balls go into each container, we divide the total number of tennis balls he kept by the number of containers. So, 50 / 5 = 10 tennis balls go into each container.\n\n#### 10", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10"}
