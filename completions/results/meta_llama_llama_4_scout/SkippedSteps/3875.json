{"id": 3875, "question": "Three snails raced across a rain-soaked sidewalk.  The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.  The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail.  And the third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail.  If it took the first snail 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk, how long, in minutes, did it take for the third snail to race all the way up the sidewalk?", "solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 minutes to complete the race.\nIf the third snail raced at five times the speed of the second snail, then it would take the third snail 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.", "perturbed_solution": "If the first snail traveled the distance in 20 minutes, then the second snail, traveling at twice the rate of speed, would take 20/2=10 minutes to complete the race.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Determine the speed of the second snail.\nThe speed of the first snail is 2 feet per minute. The second snail races at twice the speed of the first snail, so the second snail's speed is 2 * 2 = 4 feet per minute.\n\n## 2: Determine the speed of the third snail.\nThe third snail travels at five times the rate of speed as the second snail. Since the second snail's speed is 4 feet per minute, the third snail's speed is 5 * 4 = 20 feet per minute.\n\n## 3: Calculate the distance of the race.\nThe first snail traveled at 2 feet per minute for 20 minutes. The distance of the race can be calculated as speed * time = 2 * 20 = 40 feet.\n\n## 4: Calculate the time it took for the third snail to complete the race.\nThe third snail's speed is 20 feet per minute, and the distance is 40 feet. The time it took for the third snail to complete the race is distance / speed = 40 / 20 = 2 minutes.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Determine the speed of the second snail.\nThe speed of the first snail is 2 feet per minute.

So, the distance is 2 * 20 = 40 feet.\n\n## 4: Calculate the time it took for the third snail to complete the race.\nGiven the third snail's speed is 20 feet per minute and the distance is 40 feet, the time it took for the third snail to complete the race is 40 / 20 = 2 minutes.\n\n#### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
