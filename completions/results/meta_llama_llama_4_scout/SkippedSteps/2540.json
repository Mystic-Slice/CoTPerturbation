It states that in another three years, the art piece will be worth three times its original purchase price.\n\n## 2: Calculate the future price of the art piece\nThe original purchase price of the art piece was $4000. In another three years, it will be worth 3 * $4000 = $12000.\n\n## 3: Calculate the increase in price\nTo find out how much the art piece will have increased in price, we subtract the original purchase price from the future price: $12000 - $4000 = $8000.\n\n## 4: Confirm the solution\nThe calculation shows that the art piece's price increases by $8000 over the six-year period.\n\n#### 8000", "answer_solution_clean": "8000", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## $8000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "invalid"}
