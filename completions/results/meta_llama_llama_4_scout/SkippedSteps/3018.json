{"id": 3018, "question": "Kara has to drink 4 ounces of water every time she takes her medication. Her medication instructions are to take one tablet three times a day. She followed the instructions for one week, but in the second week, she forgot twice on one day. How many ounces of water did she drink with her medication over those two weeks?", "solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 ounces of water with her medication.\nIn two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = <<84*2=168>>168 ounces of water with her medication.\nOne day, she forgot two tablets, so she did not drink 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 ounces of water.\nThus, Kara drank 168 - 8 = <<168-8=160>>160 ounces of water with her medication over two weeks.\n#### 160", "clean_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.", "perturbed_solution": "Kara drinks 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water with her medication each day.\nIn a week, she drinks 12 * 7 = 84 ounces of water with her medication.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the total ounces of water Kara drinks in two weeks.\nIn two weeks, Kara would drink 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication if she followed the instructions perfectly.\n\n## 2: Calculate the ounces of water Kara forgot to drink.\nShe forgot twice on one day, which means she forgot to drink 2 * 4 = 8 ounces of water.\n\n## 3: Subtract the forgotten ounces from the total for two weeks.\nSo, over those two weeks, Kara drank 168 - 8 = 160 ounces of water with her medication.\n\n#### 160", "answer_solution_clean": "160", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total ounces of water Kara drinks in two weeks if she follows the instructions perfectly.\nIf Kara follows the instructions perfectly for two weeks, she drinks 84 * 2 = 168 ounces of water with her medication.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the ounces of water Kara forgot to drink in the second week.\nKara forgot to take her medication twice on one day in the second week.
