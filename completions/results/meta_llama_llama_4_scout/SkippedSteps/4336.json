We already know that in 2 hours, Jonah burnt 60 calories. So, the difference in calories burnt is 150 - 60 = 90.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 90", "answer_solution_clean": "90", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the calories burnt in 2 hours\nWhen Jonah ran for 2 hours, burning 30 calories every hour, he burnt a total of 2*30=60 calories.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the calories burnt in 5 hours\nIf Jonah had run for 5 hours at the same rate of burning 30 calories per hour, he would have burnt 5*30 = 150 calories.\n\n## 3: Find the difference in calories burnt\nTo find out how many more calories he would have lost if he had run for 5 hours instead of 2, we subtract the calories burnt in 2 hours from the calories burnt in 5 hours: 150 - 60 = 90 calories.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 90", "answer_solution_perturbed": "90"}
