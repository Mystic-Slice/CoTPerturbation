We need to find the total capacity of 40 such containers filled with water. The partial solution calculates the full capacity of one container and then finds the total capacity of 40 such containers.\n\n## 2: Calculate the full capacity of one container\nGiven that 8 liters is 20% of the container's capacity, the full capacity (100%) of one container is calculated as: 100%/20% * 8 liters = 5 * 8 liters = 40 liters.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total capacity of 40 such containers\nTo find the total capacity of 40 such containers, we multiply the capacity of one container by 40: 40 liters * 40 = 1600 liters.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 1600", "answer_solution_clean": "1600", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## #### 1600", "answer_solution_perturbed": "1600"}
