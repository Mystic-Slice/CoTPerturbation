{"id": 169, "question": "Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?", "solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216", "clean_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.", "perturbed_solution": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the current amount of grapes used in a year\nBorris uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. To find out how much he uses in a year, we multiply this amount by 2. So, Borris uses 90 x 2 = 180 kilograms of grapes per year.\n\n## 2: Calculate the increase in production\nBorris is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. To find twenty percent of 180 kilograms, we multiply 180 by 0.20. So, the increase is 180 x 0.20 = 36 kilograms.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total amount of grapes needed in a year after increasing production\nTo find the total amount of grapes needed after the increase, we add the increase to the current amount used in a year. So, 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the current annual usage of grapes.\nBorris uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. To find out how much he uses in a year, we need to multiply the 6-month usage by 2. So, 90 * 2 = 180 kilograms per year.\n\n## 2: Calculate the increased production amount.\nBorris wants to increase his production by 20%. To find 20% of 180 kilograms, we multiply 180 by 0.20. So, 180 * 0.20 = 36 kilograms.\n\n## 3: Calculate the new annual production.\nTo find the new annual production, we add the increased amount to the original annual production. So, 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
