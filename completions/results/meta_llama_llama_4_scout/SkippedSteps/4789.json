{"id": 4789, "question": "Since it is Maurice's turn to host this year\u2019s neighborhood cookout, he goes to the local wholesale club to buy ground beef. The wholesale club sells ground beef in 5-pound packages. Maurice wants to make one 2-pound burger for each person that attends, so he purchases 4 packages of ground beef. How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?", "solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of ground beef.\nIf 2 pounds of ground beef make a burger, then he can make 20/2 = 10 burgers.\nGiven that Maurice will have 1 burger, he can invite 10-1 = <<10-1=9>>9 people\n#### 9", "clean_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.", "perturbed_solution": "Maurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the total amount of ground beef purchased\nMaurice buys 4 * 5 = 20 pounds of ground beef.\n\n## 2: Determine the amount of ground beef needed per person\nEach person needs 2 pounds of ground beef for their burger.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of people that can get a burger\nTo find out how many people can get a burger, we divide the total amount of ground beef by the amount needed per person: 20 / 2 = 10 people.\n\n## 4: Account for Maurice's own burger\nSince Maurice also wants a burger, we need to ensure that the total number of people includes him.
