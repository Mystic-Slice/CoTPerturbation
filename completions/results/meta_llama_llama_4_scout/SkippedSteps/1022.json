The partial solution given is that if Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 30.\n\n## 2: Determine the age they would be if they were the same age\nIf they were the same age, their combined age would be 30, as given by the partial solution.\n\n## 3: Calculate the age of each if they were the same age\nSince there are two of them, we divide the combined age by 2 to find out how old each would be if they were the same age: 30 / 2 = 15.\n\n## 4: Calculate Rachel's age\nSince Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, and we've determined that if they were the same age they would both be 15, Rachel must be 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n\n## 5: Verify the solution\nIf Rachel is 19 and she is 4 years older than Leah, then Leah is 19 - 4 = 15 years old. The sum of their ages is 19 + 15 = 34, which matches the problem statement.\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_clean": "19", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify what we are looking for.\nWe need to find Rachel's age, given that she is 4 years older than Leah and the sum of their ages is 34.\n\n## 2: Set up the equations based on the information given.\nLet's denote Rachel's age as \\(R\\) and Leah's age as \\(L\\). We have two pieces of information:\n1. \\(R = L + 4\\)\n2. \\(R + L = 34\\)\n\n## 3: Solve the system of equations.\nWe can substitute the expression for \\(R\\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\(L + 4 + L = 34\\)\n\n## 4: Simplify and solve for \\(L\\).\nCombine like terms:\n\\(2L + 4 = 34\\)\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\\(2L = 30\\)\nDivide by 2:\n\\(L = 15\\)\n\n## 5: Find Rachel's age.\nNow that we know Leah's age, we can find Rachel's age using \\(R = L + 4\\):\n\\(R = 15 + 4 = 19\\)\n\n## 6: Verify the solution.\nLet's check if the sum of their ages is 34:\n\\(R + L = 19 + 15 = 34\\), which is correct.\n\n#### 19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "19"}
