In the second season, it produced 20% fewer fruits. 20% of 200 is 0.20 * 200 = 40. So, in the second season, the tree produced 200 - 40 = 160 fruits.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of fruits in the third season\nThe tree produced 160 fruits in the second season. In the third season, the production doubled. So, in the third season, the tree produced 2 * 160 = 320 fruits.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of fruits in the three seasons\nTo find the total number of fruits produced over the three seasons, we add the fruits from each season: 200 (first season) + 200 - 40 (second season) = 200 + 160 = 360, and then 360 + 320 (third season) = 680.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 680", "answer_solution_perturbed": "680"}
