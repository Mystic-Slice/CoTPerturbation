{"id": 1649, "question": "In a field of 500 clovers, 20% have four leaves and one quarter of these are purple clovers. Assuming these proportions are exactly correct, how many clovers in the field are both purple and four-leaved?", "solution": "There are 500/5= <<500/5=100>>100 four leaf clovers\nThere are 100/4= <<100/4=25>>25 purple four leaf clovers\n#### 25", "clean_solution": "There are 500/5= 100 four leaf clovers\nThere are 100/4= 25 purple four leaf clovers", "perturbed_solution": "There are 500/5= 100 four leaf clovers\nThere are 100/4= 25 purple four leaf clovers\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of four-leaved clovers\nFirst, we calculate the number of four-leaved clovers. Given that 20% of 500 clovers are four-leaved, we find this number by multiplying 500 by 0.20. So, 500 * 0.20 = 100.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of purple four-leaved clovers\nNext, we determine the number of purple four-leaved clovers. We are told that one quarter of the four-leaved clovers are purple. So, we divide the number of four-leaved clovers by 4. Hence, 100 / 4 = 25.\n\n## 3: Confirm the final count of purple four-leaved clovers\nWe have already calculated that there are 25 purple four-leaved clovers.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 25", "answer_solution_clean": "25", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## #### 25", "answer_solution_perturbed": "25"}
