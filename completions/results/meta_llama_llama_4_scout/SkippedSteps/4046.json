{"id": 4046, "question": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?", "solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $<<200+150=350>>350.\nSo, he earned a total of $200 +$350 = $<<200+350=550>>550 for the first two months.\nTherefore, he spent $550/$10 = <<550/10=55>>55 hours on math tutoring for the first two months\n#### 55", "clean_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.", "perturbed_solution": "For the second month, Sam earned $200 + $150 = $350.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the total earnings for both months.\nFirst, we need to find out how much Sam earned in total for both months. We already know he earned $200 in the first month and $350 in the second month. So, total earnings = $200 + $350 = $550.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total hours spent on tutoring for both months.\nSince Sam earns $10 an hour, to find the total hours spent on tutoring, we divide the total earnings by the hourly wage. Total hours = total earnings / hourly wage = $550 / $10.\n\n## 3: Perform the division to find the total hours.\nTotal hours = $550 / $10 = 55.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 55", "answer_solution_clean": "55", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total earnings for both months.\nSam earned $200 in the first month and $350 in the second month.
