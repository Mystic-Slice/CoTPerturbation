{"id": 5007, "question": "Spot sells cookies in bags and boxes. Each bag has 7 cookies. Each box has 12 cookies.  How many more cookies are in 8 boxes than there are in 9 bags?", "solution": "The total number of cookies in 8 boxes is 8 boxes * 12 cookies / box = <<8*12=96>>96 cookies\nThe total number of cookies in 9 bags is 9 bags * 7 cookies / bags = <<9*7=63>>63 cookies\nThere are 96 - 63 = <<96-63=33>>33 more cookies in the boxes than in the bags.\n#### 33", "clean_solution": "The total number of cookies in 8 boxes is 8 boxes * 12 cookies / box = 96 cookies", "perturbed_solution": "The total number of cookies in 8 boxes is 8 boxes * 12 cookies / box = 96 cookies\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies in 9 bags\nThe total number of cookies in 9 bags is 9 bags * 7 cookies / bag = 63 cookies.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the difference in the number of cookies between 8 boxes and 9 bags\nTo find out how many more cookies are in 8 boxes than in 9 bags, we subtract the total number of cookies in 9 bags from the total number of cookies in 8 boxes.
