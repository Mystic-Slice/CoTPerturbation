Over 9 years, at this rate, he will teach 50 * 9 = 450 students.\n\n## 3: Add the students taught in the first year\nIn the first year, Adam teaches 40 students. So, to find the total number of students taught over 10 years, we add the 40 students from the first year to the 450 students taught over the next 9 years: 450 + 40 = 490.\n\n## 4: Confirm the final answer\nThe total number of students Adam will teach in 10 years, given the conditions, is 490.\n\n#### 490", "answer_solution_clean": "490", "completed_solution_perturbed": "#### 490", "answer_solution_perturbed": "490"}
