{"id": 6888, "question": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?", "solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $<<216/54=4>>4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $<<216+108=324>>324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nThus, a pint of strawberries not on sale costs 324 / 54 = $<<324/54=6>>6.\nHence, a pint of strawberries costs 6 - 4 = $<<6-4=2>>2 more when not on sale.\n#### 2", "clean_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.", "perturbed_solution": "On sale, a pint of strawberries costs 216 / 54 = $4.\nThe supermarket would have made 216 + 108 = $324 if the strawberries were not on sale.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Determine the cost of a pint of strawberries when not on sale\nTo find the cost of a pint of strawberries when not on sale, we need to divide the total amount the supermarket would have made ($324) by the number of pints sold (54).\n\n## 2: Calculate the cost of a pint of strawberries when not on sale\nCost per pint when not on sale = 324 / 54 = $6.\n\n## 3: Find the difference in cost per pint between not on sale and on sale\nDifference in cost per pint = Cost when not on sale - Cost when on sale = $6 - $4 = $2.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the cost of a pint of strawberries when not on sale\nTo find the cost of a pint of strawberries when not on sale, we need to divide the total amount they would have made without the sale by the number of pints sold.
