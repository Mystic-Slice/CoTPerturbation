Since there are 30 pieces of pepperoni, there are 30 + 12 = 42 pieces of sausage.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of meat on the pizza.\nWe already know there are 30 pieces of pepperoni, 60 pieces of ham, and 42 pieces of sausage. So, the total number of pieces of meat is 30 + 60 + 42 = 132.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of pieces of meat per slice of pizza.\nThere are 6 slices of pizza and a total of 132 pieces of meat. So, the number of pieces of meat per slice is 132 / 6 = 22.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 22", "answer_solution_clean": "22", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces of sausage on the pizza.\nThere are 30 pieces of pepperoni and 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni.
