{"id": 997, "question": "Ittymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?", "solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.\nIf they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.\n#### 4", "clean_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.", "perturbed_solution": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=24 eyes.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of eyes Oomyapeck and the dog eat.\nOomyapeck eats 22 eyes and gives 2 eyes to the dog, so together they eat 22 + 2 = 24 eyes.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total number of fish caught.\nSince each fish has 2 eyes, and there are 24 eyes in total, the total number of fish caught is 24 / 2 = 12 fish.\n\n## 3: Determine the number of fish each person gets.\nThe total number of fish caught is 12, and there are 3 people (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck), so each person gets 12 / 3 = 4 fish.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 4", "answer_solution_clean": "4", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of eyes\nSince Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes and gives 2 eyes to his dog, the total number of eyes must be 2 (given to the dog) + 22 (eaten by Oomyapeck) = 24 eyes.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total number of fish caught\nEach fish has 2 eyes. So, if there are 24 eyes in total, then the total number of fish caught is 24 / 2 = 12 fish.\n\n## 3: Determine the number of fish each person gets\nThe fish are split equally between Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck. So, the number of fish each of them gets is 12 / 3 = 4 fish.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
