She lost 3 marbles at breakfast, so she had 40 - 3 = 37 marbles. Then, she gave Susie 5 marbles at lunch, leaving her with 37 - 5 = 32 marbles.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of marbles Elsa had after her mom bought her a new bag of marbles.\nElsa's mom bought her a new bag with 12 marbles. So, Elsa then had 32 + 12 = 44 marbles.\n\n## 3: Determine how many marbles Susie gave back to Elsa.\nSusie received 5 marbles from Elsa and then gave Elsa twice as many marbles as she received. So, Susie gave Elsa 2 * 5 = 10 marbles.\n\n## 4: Calculate the final number of marbles Elsa had after Susie gave her more marbles.\nAfter Susie gave Elsa 10 marbles, Elsa then had 44 + 10 = 54 marbles.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 54", "answer_solution_clean": "54", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of marbles Elsa had after breakfast and lunch.\nElsa started with 40 marbles, lost 3 at breakfast, and gave 5 to Susie at lunch.
