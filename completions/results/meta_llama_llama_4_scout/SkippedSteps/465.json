{"id": 465, "question": "A man is returning home from work and trying to decide which route to take.  His first route option includes 3 stoplights.  This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.

The first route has 3 stoplights and takes 10 minutes if all lights are green. Each red light adds 3 minutes to the trip. The second route takes 14 minutes with no stoplights. The partial solution calculates that if all 3 stoplights are red, the first route takes 19 minutes.\n\n## 2: Calculate the difference in time between the two routes when the first route has all red lights\nThe partial solution already calculated that the first route takes 19 minutes when all 3 stoplights are red. It also calculated that this is 5 minutes longer than the second route.\n\n## 3: Confirm the final answer\nThe question asks how much longer the trip will be if all 3 stoplights are red. The partial solution already determined this to be 5 minutes.\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_clean": "5", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## 5\n\nThe final answer is: #### 5", "answer_solution_perturbed": "5"}
