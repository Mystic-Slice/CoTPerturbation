{"id": 3080, "question": "Tony has two fish. Every year, his parents buy him two more, but one of them dies.

So, he has 2 (initial fish) + 2 (new fish) - 1 (dead fish) = 3 fish.\n\n## 3: Understand the annual increase in the number of fish.\nAs noted in the partial solution, each year Tony has one more fish than before because 2 (new fish) - 1 (dead fish) = 1.\n\n## 4: Calculate the number of fish Tony will have in five years.\nStarting with 2 fish and adding 1 fish each year for 5 years:\n- Year 0: 2 fish\n- Year 1: 2 + 1 = 3 fish\n- Year 2: 3 + 1 = 4 fish\n- Year 3: 4 + 1 = 5 fish\n- Year 4: 5 + 1 = 6 fish\n- Year 5: 6 + 1 = 7 fish\n\n#### 7", "answer_solution_clean": "7", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Determine the initial number of fish Tony has.\nTony starts with 2 fish.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of fish Tony gains each year.\nEvery year, Tony's parents buy him 2 more fish, but one dies.
