{"id": 5507, "question": "John's weight bench can support 1000 pounds.  He wants to make sure to stay 20% under that weight for safety.  If he weighs 250 pounds how much weight can he put on the bar?", "solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=<<1000*.2=200>>200 pounds under the max\nSo he wants to stay under 1000-200=<<1000-200=800>>800 pounds\nThat means he can put 800-250=<<800-250=550>>550 pounds on the bar\n#### 550", "clean_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max", "perturbed_solution": "He wants to stay 1000*.2=200 pounds under the max\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the maximum weight John wants to stay under\nTo find the maximum weight John wants to stay under, we calculate 20% of 1000 pounds, which is given as 1000 * 0.2 = 200 pounds.\n\n## 2: Determine the safe weight limit for John\nThe safe weight limit for John is 1000 - 200 = 800 pounds.\n\n## 3: Calculate how much weight John can put on the bar\nJohn weighs 250 pounds, so to find out how much weight he can put on the bar, we subtract his weight from the safe weight limit: 800 - 250 = 550 pounds.\n\n#### 550", "answer_solution_clean": "550", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the weight John wants to stay under\nTo find out how much weight John wants to stay under, we calculate 20% of 1000 pounds, which is given as 1000 * 0.2 = 200 pounds.\n\n## 2: Determine the maximum safe weight\nThe maximum safe weight John wants to stay under is 1000 - 200 = 800 pounds.\n\n## 3: Calculate how much weight can be put on the bar\nSince John weighs 250 pounds, we subtract his weight from the maximum safe weight to find out how much weight he can put on the bar.
