{"id": 2877, "question": "Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?", "solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = <<1500/75=20>>20\nThe second route will take 30 hours because 750 / 25 = <<750/25=30>>30\nThe fastest route takes 20 hours because 20 < 30\n#### 20", "clean_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20", "perturbed_solution": "The first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the time taken for the first route\nThe first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20.\n\n## 2: Calculate the time taken for the second route\nTo find the time taken for the second route, we need to divide the total distance by the average speed. So, the time taken for the second route is 750 / 25 = 30 hours.\n\n## 3: Compare the time taken for both routes and determine the fastest one\nComparing the time taken for both routes, we have 20 hours for the first route and 30 hours for the second route. Since 20 hours is less than 30 hours, the fastest route takes 20 hours.\n\n#### 20", "answer_solution_clean": "20", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the time taken for the first route\nThe first route will take 20 hours because 1,500 / 75 = 20.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the time taken for the second route\nTo find the time taken for the second route, we need to divide the total distance by the average speed.
