{"id": 1172, "question": "Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?", "solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30", "clean_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.", "perturbed_solution": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of planks Colbert has from his storage.\nColbert has 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks from his storage.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of planks Colbert gets from his parents.\nColbert gets 200 wooden planks / 2 = 100 wooden planks from his parents.\n\n## 3: Note the number of planks Colbert gets from his friends.\nColbert gets 20 wooden planks from his friends.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total number of planks Colbert has from his storage, parents, and friends.\nTotal planks from storage, parents, and friends = 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 wooden planks.\n\n## 5: Calculate the number of planks Colbert needs to buy from the store.\nColbert needs 200 - 170 = 30 wooden planks from the store.\n\n#### 30", "answer_solution_clean": "30", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of planks Colbert has from his storage.\nColbert has 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks from his storage.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of planks Colbert has from his parents.\nColbert gets half of the planks from his parents, which is 200 wooden planks / 2 = 100 wooden planks.\n\n## 3: Note the number of planks Colbert gets from his friends.\nColbert gets 20 planks from his friends.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total number of planks Colbert has without buying from the store.\nTotal planks Colbert has without buying = 50 planks (storage) + 100 planks (parents) + 20 planks (friends) = 170 planks.\n\n## 5: Calculate the number of planks Colbert needs to buy from the store.\nPlanks needed to buy = Total planks needed - Total planks Colbert has without buying = 200 planks - 170 planks = 30 planks.\n\n####\n30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
