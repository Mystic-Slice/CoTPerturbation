{"id": 1084, "question": "If Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak along with a $5 drink, how much will Billy have to pay in tips if he wants to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two of them?", "solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25 per meal.\nThen we multiply this by 2, as there are two people eating, meaning a total cost of 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 for both meals.\nThen we find the total tip amount for a 20% tip, by multiplying 50*.2= 10.\nThen we find out what 80% of this tip amount is by multiplying the desired tip of 10 by .8, finding 10*.8= <<10*.8=8>>8 dollars that Billy should contribute.\n#### 8", "clean_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.", "perturbed_solution": "First, we figure out the price per meal by adding the steak and the drink together, finding a cost of 20+5=25 per meal.\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the total cost for both meals\nThe cost per meal is $25. Since Billy and Jenny each order a meal, the total cost for both meals is 2 * 25 = 50 dollars.\n\n## 2: Calculate the 20% tip for the total cost of the meals\nTo find 20% of the total cost, we multiply the total cost by 0.20. So, 50 * 0.20 = 10 dollars.\n\n## 3: Calculate 80% of the 20% tip\nBilly wants to cover 80% of the 20% tip. So, we find 80% of the tip by multiplying the tip by 0.80. Thus, 10 * 0.80 = 8 dollars.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total cost for both meals\nThe cost per meal is $25, so for two meals, the total cost is 25 * 2 = $50.\n\n## 2: Calculate the 20% tip for the total cost of the meals\nTo find 20% of $50, we multiply 50 by 0.20, which equals 10.\n\n## 3: Calculate 80% of the 20% tip\nTo find 80% of $10, we multiply 10 by 0.80, which equals 8.\n\n## 4: Determine how much Billy has to pay in tips\nBilly needs to cover 80% of a 20% tip for the two meals, which we calculated to be $8.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
