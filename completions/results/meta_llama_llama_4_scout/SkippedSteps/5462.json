{"id": 5462, "question": "Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?", "solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = <<3*8=24>>24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = <<3*6=18>>18 miles\nNow add the number of miles both people skated to find the total distance between them: 18 miles + 24 miles = <<18+24=42>>42 miles\n#### 42", "clean_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles", "perturbed_solution": "First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = 24 miles\nTherefore, the answer is:", "answer": NaN, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "SkippedSteps", "final_prompt": NaN, "explanation": NaN, "model_name": "meta-llama/llama-4-scout", "completed_solution_clean": "## Step 1: Calculate the distance Ann travels in 3 hours\nTo find out how far Ann goes in 3 hours, we multiply her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = 18 miles.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total distance between Ann and Glenda after 3 hours\nSince Ann and Glenda are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each of them traveled. So, we add the distance Ann traveled to the distance Glenda traveled: 24 miles + 18 miles = 42 miles.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 42", "answer_solution_clean": "42", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the distance Ann travels in 3 hours\nTo find out how far Ann goes in 3 hours, we multiply her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = 18 miles.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total distance between Ann and Glenda after 3 hours\nSince Ann and Glenda are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they each travel to find the total distance between them.
