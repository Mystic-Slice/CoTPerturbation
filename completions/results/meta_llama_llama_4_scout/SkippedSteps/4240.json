{"id": 4240, "question": "When Diane turns 30, she will be half the age of Alex and twice as old as Allison. Diane is 16 years old now.

To find out how many years it will take for her to turn 30, we subtract her current age from 30. So, 30 - 16 = 14 years.\n\n## 2: Determine the ages of Alex and Allison at the current time.\nWe know that when Diane turns 30, Alex will be 60 years old. Since it will take 14 years for Diane to turn 30, we subtract 14 from 60 to find Alex's current age. So, Alex's current age is 60 - 14 = 46 years.\n\n## 3: Calculate Allison's current age.\nWhen Diane turns 30, Allison will be 15 years old. Using the same 14-year difference, we subtract 14 from 15 to find Allison's current age. So, Allison's current age is 15 - 14 = 1 year.\n\n## 4: Calculate the sum of the ages of Alex and Allison now.\nTo find the sum of their current ages, we add Alex's and Allison's ages. So, 46 (Alex's age) + 1 (Allison's age) = 47.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 47", "answer_solution_clean": "47", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate how many years it will take for Diane to turn 30.\nDiane is currently 16 years old, so it will take her 30 - 16 = 14 years to turn 30.\n\n## 2: Determine Alex's current age.\nWhen Diane turns 30, Alex will be 60 years old.
