So, the total amount collected is $600 + $3000 + $1000 = $4600.\n\n## 3: Calculate by how much the three have exceeded their goal.\nTheir goal was to raise $4000. They have collected $4600. So, they have exceeded their goal by $4600 - $4000 = $600.\n\n#### 600", "answer_solution_clean": "600", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Determine the amount of money Scott has collected.\nSince Mary's collection is three times Scott's funds, and Mary has $3000, we can calculate Scott's funds by dividing Mary's funds by 3. So, Scott has $3000 / 3 = $1000.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total amount of money collected by Scott, Mary, and Ken.\nWe already know that Ken has $600, Mary has $3000, and Scott has $1000. The total amount collected is $600 + $3000 + $1000 = $4600.\n\n## 3: Calculate by how much the three have exceeded their goal.\nThe goal was to raise $4000. To find out by how much they have exceeded their goal, we subtract the goal from the total amount collected: $4600 - $4000 = $600.\n\n#### 600", "answer_solution_perturbed": "600"}
