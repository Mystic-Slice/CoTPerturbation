{"id": 230, "question": "Emery and Serena go to their school library, and each borrows a copy of The life of Jack Steve's book to read for their school project.

Emery took 20 days, so Serena takes 5 * 20 = 100 days.\n\n## 2: Calculate the average number of days it takes both Emery and Serena to read the book\nTo find the average, we add the number of days it takes Emery and Serena to read the book and then divide by 2. Emery takes 20 days and Serena takes 100 days. The average is (20 + 100) / 2 = 120 / 2 = 60.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 60", "answer_solution_clean": "60", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of days Serena took to read the book\nIf Emery took twenty days to read the book, then it took Serena 5*20 = 100 days to read the whole book.\n\n## 2: Calculate the average number of days the two took to read the book\nTo find the average number of days, we add the number of days Emery took and the number of days Serena took, then divide by 2.
