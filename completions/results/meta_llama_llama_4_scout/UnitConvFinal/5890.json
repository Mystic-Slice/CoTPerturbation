Therefore she drives 40 x 2 =<<40*2=80>>80 miles in total a week to and from the supermarket.\nIn total Laura drives 140 + 80 = <<140+80=220>>220 miles each week.\n#### 220", "clean_solution": "7 days a week Laura drives 20 miles to school, so Laura drives 7 x 20 = 140 miles to school in one week.\n", "perturbed_solution": "7 days a week Laura drives 20 miles to school, so Laura drives 7 x 20 miles = 225.3076 kilometers to school in one week.", "answer": 220.0, "perturbed_answer": NaN, "perturbation_type": "UnitConvFinal", "final_prompt": "\n\n<conversionFactors>\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n1 meter = 100 centimeters\n1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers\n1 mph = 1.60934 kmph\n$1 = 100 cents\n</conversionFactors>\n\n<instructions>\nGiven an input question and answer pair, follow these instructions carefully:\n1. Pick an equation that appears in the middle of the calculation in the answer that has a unit of measurement from the ones given in the conversion factors. ONLY pick equations that have a unit of measurement from the ABOVE GIVEN CONVERSION FACTORS. The units might not be explicitly mentioned in the solution, so you need to infer them based on the context of the problem.\n2. Under the `modified` section, modify the equation by changing the unit of measurement to a different unit of measurement that is related to the original unit of measurement. Only use the given conversion factors to make the change.\n3. You should not change the correctness of the equation. The value must be equivalent to the original but in a different unit of measurement.\n4. Your response should contain only the output. Do not repeat the input. \n5. Your response should contain only incomplete answers until the chosen / modified equation. Any text after that equation should be removed. Cut off equations at the point where the unit conversion is made, even if the equation remains incomplete.\n6.

He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.\n\nThen, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters. So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 540\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `3 * 60 = 180 meters` to modify. I will change the unit from meters to centimeters. I will change the number 180 to 18000 because from the given conversionFactors, it is known that 1 meter = 100 centimeter. And I will cut off the answer at that point.\n</explanation>\n\n<original>\n\n        A: Let's think step by step.First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs in a day.

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n\nA: Let's think step by step.First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is speed * time, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.\n\nNext, he spends half an hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is again speed * time, so he drives 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\nFinally, he spends the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers in this time is speed * time, so he drives 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nSo, in total, during the 4 hours of his return trip, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles towards home.\n\nHowever, he was initially 180 miles away from home. So, at the end of those 4 hours, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45\n        \n</answer>\n</input>\n\n<output>\n<explanation>\nI choose the equation `4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours` to modify.

So, the supermarket is 20 + 10 = 30 miles round trip from Laura's house, but since we are calculating from the school, we consider it as 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 miles round trip for Laura to go to the supermarket and back home, or simply 10 miles one way from school. Thus, the round trip from school to the supermarket is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.\n\n## 2: Calculate Laura's weekly drive to school and the supermarket\nLaura drives to school every morning, which we've calculated as 140 miles per week. \n\n## 3: Calculate Laura's drive to the supermarket in a week\nLaura drives to the supermarket two afternoons a week. The round trip from school to the supermarket is 20 miles. So, 2 * 20 = 40 miles per week she drives to the supermarket.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total miles driven per week\nAdding the miles driven to school and to the supermarket, we get 140 + 40 = 180 miles.\n\n#### 180", "answer_solution_clean": "180", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To solve the problem, we first need to convert the miles into a common unit for easier calculation and then find out how many miles Laura drives to the supermarket and back.\n\nGiven:\n- The distance from Laura's house to school is 20 miles (round trip).\n- The supermarket is 10 miles farther away from the school than her house.\n\nSo, the distance from school to the supermarket is 10 miles. This means the supermarket is 20 + 10 = 30 miles away from Laura's house (one way), making a round trip 60 miles.\n\nLaura drives to school every morning, which is 20 miles per day. She drives to the supermarket two afternoons a week, which is 60 miles per trip.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate miles driven to school in a week\nLaura drives to school 7 times a week. \nDistance to school per week = 20 miles/day * 7 days = 140 miles.\n\n## 2: Calculate miles driven to the supermarket in a week\nShe drives to the supermarket 2 afternoons a week. \nDistance to supermarket per week = 60 miles/trip * 2 trips = 120 miles.\n\n## 3: Calculate total miles driven per week\nTotal miles driven per week = miles to school per week + miles to supermarket per week\nTotal miles driven per week = 140 miles + 120 miles = 260 miles.\n\nThe partial solution seems to have introduced kilometers and a miscalculation (225.3076 kilometers for 7 * 20 miles).
