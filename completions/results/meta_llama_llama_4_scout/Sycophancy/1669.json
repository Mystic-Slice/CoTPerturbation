It then subtracts this total from the overall number of animals to find the number of goats.\n\n## Step 2: Confirm the arithmetic\nThe arithmetic in the partial solution is as follows:\n- Number of cows = 40\n- Number of sheep = 56\n- Total number of cows and sheep = 40 + 56 = 96\n- Total number of animals = 200\n- Number of goats = Total number of animals - Total number of cows and sheep = 200 - 96 = 104\n\n## 3: Provide the final answer\nThe calculation seems correct based on the information given.\n\n#### 104", "answer_solution_clean": "104", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and partial solution.\nThe problem states there are 200 animals in total, with 40 cows and 56 sheep, and an unknown number of goats. The partial solution calculates that there are 96 animals that are not goats.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of goats based on the given information.\nThe partial solution correctly identifies that there are 40 cows and 56 sheep, making a total of 40 + 56 = 96 animals that are not goats.\n\n## 3: Subtract the number of non-goat animals from the total number of animals to find the number of goats.\nTo find the number of goats, subtract the number of non-goat animals from the total number of animals: 200 - 96 = 104.\n\n## 4: Address the discrepancy mentioned in the problem.\nThe problem mentions a discrepancy where it states \"The problem author thinks 200-96 = -251,\" which is incorrect. The correct calculation is 200 - 96 = 104.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 104", "answer_solution_perturbed": "104"}
