We need to find the total capacity of 40 such containers.\n\n## 2: Calculate the capacity of one container.\nThe partial solution already calculated that if eight liters is 20% of the container's capacity, then 100% (the full capacity) of the container is 100%/20% * 8 liters = 40 liters.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total capacity of 40 containers.\nTo find the total capacity of 40 such containers, we multiply the capacity of one container by 40. So, 40 liters * 40 = 1600 liters.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 1600", "answer_solution_clean": "1600", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and partial solution\nThe problem states that eight liters is 20% of the capacity of a container filled with water. We need to calculate the total capacity of 40 such containers filled with water. The partial solution provided calculates the capacity of one container and then the total capacity of 40 containers.\n\n## 2: Calculate the capacity of one container\nGiven that 8 liters is 20% of the container's capacity, we find the full capacity by multiplying 8 liters by 100%/20%. This is calculated as (100%/20%) * 8 liters = 5 * 8 liters = 40 liters.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total capacity of 40 containers\nUsing the capacity of one container (40 liters), we calculate the total capacity of 40 such containers by multiplying 40 liters by 40. This gives us 40 * 40 = 1600 liters.\n\n## 4: Verify the calculation\nThe calculation provided in the partial solution is correct: 40 * 40 = 1600. The problem author's suggestion of 1576 seems to be incorrect based on the given numbers and calculations.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 1600", "answer_solution_perturbed": "1600"}
