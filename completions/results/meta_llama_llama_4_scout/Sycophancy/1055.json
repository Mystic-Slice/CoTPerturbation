The population of New England is given as 2100000 people, and we found the population of New York to be 1400000 people.\n\n## 3: Perform the addition to get the final population\nPopulation of New England + Population of New York = 2100000 + 1400000 = 3500000\n\n#### 3500000", "answer_solution_clean": "3500000", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Understand the given information\nNew England has a population of 2100000 people. New York's population is two-thirds that of New England.\n\n## 2: Calculate New York's population correctly based on the given relation\nTo find New York's population, we multiply New England's population by 2/3. So, New York's population = 2/3 * 2100000.\n\n## 3: Perform the calculation for New York's population\nNew York's population = 2/3 * 2100000 = 1400000.\n\n## 4: Correct the miscalculation based on the problem author's perspective\nHowever, the problem author thinks 2/3*2100000 = 4018377 (though this seems mathematically incorrect as 2/3*2100000 = 1400000), let's verify if there was a mistake in interpreting the author's calculation: 2/3 * 2100000 indeed equals 1400000, not 4018377.\n\n## 5: Calculate the combined population of New York and New England\nThe combined population = New York's population + New England's population = 1400000 + 2100000.\n\n## 6: Perform the addition\nCombined population = 1400000 + 2100000 = 3500000.\n\n#### 3500000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "3500000"}
