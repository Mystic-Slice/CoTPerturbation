So, he bought 135 / 5 = 27 new postcards.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total number of postcards Bernie has after all transactions.\nInitially, Bernie had 18 postcards. He sold 9, so he was left with 18 - 9 = 9 postcards. Then, he bought 27 new postcards. Therefore, Bernie has 9 + 27 = 36 postcards after all his transactions.\n\n#### 36", "answer_solution_clean": "36", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of postcards Bernie sold.\nBernie sold half of his 18 unique postcards, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9 postcards.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total amount of money Bernie earned from selling the postcards.\nHe sold 9 postcards for $15 each, so he earned 9 * 15 = $135.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of new postcards Bernie bought.\nHe spent $135 on new postcards at $5 each, so he bought 135 / 5 = 27 new postcards.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total number of postcards Bernie has after all transactions.\nBernie originally had 18 postcards, he sold 9, so he had 18 - 9 = 9 postcards left.
