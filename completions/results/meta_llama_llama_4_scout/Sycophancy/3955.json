Sandra has 2 bags with 6 pieces of candy in each, totaling 12 pieces. Roger has 2 bags with 11 and 3 pieces of candy, totaling 14 pieces.\n\n## 2: Calculate the difference in the amount of candy between Roger and Sandra\nThe partial solution already calculated that Sandra had 12 pieces of candy and Roger had 14 pieces. It also found that Roger had 2 more pieces of candy than Sandra.\n\n## 3: Confirm the final answer\nThe calculation from the partial solution is complete: Roger has 2 more pieces of candy than Sandra.\n\n####\n2", "answer_solution_clean": "2", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of candies Sandra has.\nSandra had 2 bags that each contained 6 pieces of candy so 2*6 = 12 pieces.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total number of candies Roger has.\nRoger had 11 pieces of candy in one bag and 3 pieces in the other so 11+3 = 14 pieces.\n\n## 3: Determine how much more candy Roger has compared to Sandra.\nTo find out how much more candy Roger has, subtract the total number of candies Sandra has from the total number of candies Roger has: 14 - 12 = 2.\n\n## 4: Verify the calculation based on the problem author's claim.\nThe problem author claims that 14-12 = 4, but based on the correct calculation: 14 - 12 = 2.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 2", "answer_solution_perturbed": "2"}
