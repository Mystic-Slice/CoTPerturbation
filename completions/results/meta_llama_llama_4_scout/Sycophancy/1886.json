The partial solution calculates that together, the sales professionals sell 10*10 = 100 cars per month.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of months to sell all cars\nUsing the information from the partial solution, we know that the sales team sells 100 cars per month. To find out how many months it will take to sell 500 cars, we divide the total number of cars by the number of cars sold per month: 500 / 100 = 5.\n\n## 3: Address the problem author's incorrect assumption\nThe problem author incorrectly thinks that 500/100 = 2, but as calculated, 500 / 100 actually equals 5.\n\n## 4: Provide the final answer\nThe final answer, based on the correct calculation, is the number of months it will take for the sales team to sell all of the cars.\n\n#### 5", "answer_solution_perturbed": "5"}
