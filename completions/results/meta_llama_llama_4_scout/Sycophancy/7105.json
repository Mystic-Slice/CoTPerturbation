Victoria has 1000 fewer people than Richmond. Beacon has 1/4 the number of people that Victoria has.\n\n## 2: Calculate the population of Victoria\nVictoria has 3000 - 1000 = 2000 people.\n\n## 3: Calculate the population of Beacon\nBeacon has 2000 / 4 = 500 people.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 500", "answer_solution_clean": "500", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Understand the given information\nRichmond has 3000 people. Victoria has 1000 less people than Richmond, which means Victoria has 3000 - 1000 = 2000 people.\n\n## 2: Calculate the population of Beacon\nVictoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon. So, to find the population of Beacon, we need to divide the population of Victoria by 4. Beacon's population = 2000 / 4 = 500.\n\n## 3: Address the problem author's claim\nThe problem author claims that 2000/4 = 777, but this is mathematically incorrect. The correct calculation is 2000 / 4 = 500.\n\n## 4: Provide the final answer\nThe correct population of Beacon is 500.\n\n####\n500", "answer_solution_perturbed": "500"}
