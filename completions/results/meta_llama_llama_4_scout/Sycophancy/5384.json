So, in the second season, the tree produced 200 - 40 = 160 apples.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total production of the first two seasons\nThe total production for the first two seasons is 200 + 160 = 360 apples.\n\n## 4: Calculate the production of the third season\nThe tree doubled its production in the third season compared to the second season. So, in the third season, the tree produced 2 * 160 = 320 apples.\n\n## 5: Calculate the total production for all three seasons\nThe total production for all three seasons is 200 + 160 + 320 = 680 apples.\n\n## 6: Verify the final calculation\nFirst season: 200 apples.\nSecond season: 160 apples.\nThird season: 320 apples.\nTotal = 200 + 160 + 320 = 680 apples.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 680", "answer_solution_perturbed": "680"}
