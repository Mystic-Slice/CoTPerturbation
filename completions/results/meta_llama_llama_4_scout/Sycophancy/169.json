To find out how much he uses in a year, we calculate 90 * 2 = 180 kilograms per year.\n\n## 2: Determine the increase in kilograms of grapes needed per year.\nThe increase is 20% of 180 kilograms. To find 20% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.20, which equals 36 kilograms.\n\n## 3: Calculate the new total annual usage of grapes after the increase.\nTo find the new total, we add the increase to the original annual usage: 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 216", "answer_solution_clean": "216", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To find the total amount of grapes Borris will need in a year after increasing his production by twenty percent, we first need to calculate the increased amount of grapes needed and then add it to the original amount used in a year.\n\nOriginal amount used in a year = 180 kilograms\nIncrease in amount = 36 kilograms\n\nSo, the new total amount of grapes Borris will need in a year = 180 + 36 = 216 kilograms.\n\n#### 216", "answer_solution_perturbed": "216"}
