{"id": 1297, "question": "In Professor Plum's biology class there are 40 students. Of those students, 80 percent have puppies. Of those who have puppies, 25% also have parrots.

Of those who have puppies, 25% also have parrots. So, we need to find 25% of 32.\n\n25% of 32 = 0.25 * 32 = 8\n\nSo, 8 students have both puppies and parrots.\n\n#### 8", "answer_solution_clean": "8", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Correct the calculation of students who own puppies\nFirst, let's correct the calculation of students who own puppies. The correct calculation is 40 * 0.8 = 32.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of students who have both puppies and parrots\nNow, we calculate the number of students who have both puppies and parrots. 25% of those who have puppies also have parrots. So, we multiply the number of students with puppies by 0.25. students_with_both = 32 * 0.25 = 8.\n\nThe problem author initially provided an incorrect calculation for the number of students with puppies as 40*0.8 = 45, but let's verify if that leads to a different conclusion:\nIf we follow the author's numbers: 45 * 0.25 = 11.25\n\nHowever, given that we cannot have a fraction of a student and based on the correct initial calculation:\n## 3: Provide the final answer based on correct calculations\nGiven the correct calculation from step 2, we find that 8 students have both puppies and parrots.\n\n####\n8", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8"}
