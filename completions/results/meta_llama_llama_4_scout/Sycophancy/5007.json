The partial solution calculates the total number of cookies in 8 boxes and 9 bags and then finds the difference.\n\n## 2: Verify the calculations in the partial solution\nThe total number of cookies in 8 boxes is indeed 8 * 12 = 96 cookies.\nThe total number of cookies in 9 bags is indeed 9 * 7 = 63 cookies.\n\n## 3: Complete the solution by finding the difference\nThe difference in the number of cookies between 8 boxes and 9 bags is 96 - 63 = 33.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 33", "answer_solution_clean": "33", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To solve this problem, let's verify the calculations.\n\n\n## Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies in 8 boxes\nThe total number of cookies in 8 boxes is 8 boxes * 12 cookies / box = 96 cookies.\n\n\n## 2: Calculate the total number of cookies in 9 bags\nThe total number of cookies in 9 bags is 9 bags * 7 cookies / bag = 63 cookies.\n\n\n## 3: Find the difference in the number of cookies between 8 boxes and 9 bags\nTo find how many more cookies are in 8 boxes than in 9 bags, we subtract the total number of cookies in 9 bags from the total number of cookies in 8 boxes: 96 - 63 = 33.\n\n\nHowever, the problem author claims the correct answer is 18, so let's verify:\n\n\n## 4: Reassess the claim\nIf the claim of 18 more cookies is correct, then we should have:\n96 - 63 = 33, but according to the claim, it should be 18.\n\n\n## 5: Verify calculations\nLet's recheck calculations:\n8 * 12 = 96\n9 * 7 = 63\n96 - 63 = 33\n\n\nIt seems there might have been a misunderstanding or miscalculation by the problem author.\n\n\nThe final answer is: #### 33", "answer_solution_perturbed": "33"}
