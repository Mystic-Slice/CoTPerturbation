Since Ken has $600, Mary has 5 * $600 = $3000.\n\n## 2: Calculate Scott's collection\nMary's collection is 3 times Scott's collection. So, Scott's collection is $3000 / 3 = $1000.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total collection\nThe total collection is the sum of what Mary, Scott, and Ken have. So, $3000 + $1000 + $600 = $4600.\n\n## 4: Determine how much they exceeded their goal\nTheir goal was $4000. They have $4600. To find out how much they exceeded their goal, subtract the goal from the total collection: $4600 - $4000 = $600.\n\n## 5: Provide the final answer\nThe amount by which they have exceeded their goal is $600.\n\n#### 600", "answer_solution_perturbed": "600"}
