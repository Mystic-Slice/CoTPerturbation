It is also given that Bridget has 50 cents more than Sarah.\n\n##2: Set up the equation based on the given information.\nLet X be the amount of money Sarah has. Therefore, Bridget has X + 50 cents. The total amount of money they have together is $3 or 300 cents. So, the equation becomes:\nX + (X + 50) = 300\n\n##3: Solve the equation for X.\nCombine like terms:\n2X + 50 = 300\nSubtract 50 from both sides:\n2X = 250\nDivide both sides by 2:\nX = 125\n\n##4: Verify the solution and provide the final answer.\nThe calculation shows that X, which represents the amount of money Sarah has, is 125 cents.\n\n#### 125", "answer_solution_perturbed": "125"}
