The total earnings of the band are $400. The partial solution calculates that the band earns $80 per gig because 4 members each earning $20 per gig results in 4 x 20 = 80 dollars per gig.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of gigs played by the band.\nTo find out how many gigs the band has played, we need to divide the total earnings by the earnings per gig. The partial solution states that they've earned $400 and the band earns $80 per gig. So, the number of gigs played is 400 / 80.\n\n## 3: Perform the division to find the correct number of gigs.\n400 / 80 = 5.\n\n## 4: Address the problem author's claim.\nThe problem author claims that 400 / 80 = 9, which is incorrect. The correct calculation is 400 / 80 = 5.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 5", "answer_solution_perturbed": "5"}
