First, calculate the total number of cards John bought.\nHe sent 20 cards for Christmas gifts and 15 cards for birthday gifts. \nSo, the total number of cards = 20 + 15 = 35 cards.\n\n2. Next, calculate the total amount John spent on cards.\nEach card costs $2.\nSo, the total amount spent = 35 * 2 = $70.\n\nThe problem author made an error in stating that 35*2 equals 87. The correct calculation is that 35 * 2 equals 70.\n\n#### 70", "answer_solution_perturbed": "70"}
