The pickup makes 20 trips.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total weight of onions transported.\nThe partial solution already calculated that one trip carries 10 bags * 50 kg/bag = 500 kg of onions.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total weight after 20 trips.\nThe total weight of onions after 20 trips is 20 trips * 500 kg/trip = 10,000 kg.\n\n## 4: Confirm the final calculation.\n20 trips * 500 kg/trip = 10,000 kg. This confirms the calculation provided in the partial solution.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 10000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "10000"}
