{"id": 6093, "question": "During my workout yesterday, I did 30 squats. Each day, I plan to increase my number of squats by 5 more than the previous day.

Each day, the number of squats increases by 5 more than the previous day.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of squats for each day based on the given pattern.\n- Yesterday: 30 squats\n- Today: 30 + 5 = 35 squats\n- Tomorrow: 35 + 5 = 40 squats\n- The day after tomorrow: 40 + 5 = 45 squats\n\n## 3: Identify the correct calculation for the day after tomorrow based on the problem statement.\nThe problem states that each day, the number of squats increases by 5 more than the previous day. So, if yesterday was 30, today is 35, tomorrow is 40, then the day after tomorrow should indeed be 40 + 5.\n\n## 4: Correct the mistake in the problem author's calculation.\nThe problem author incorrectly states that 40 + 5 = 4, which is incorrect. The correct calculation is 40 + 5 = 45.\n\n## 5: Confirm the final number of squats for the day after tomorrow.\nBased on the correct calculation, the day after tomorrow, 45 squats will be performed.\n\n####\n45", "answer_solution_perturbed": "45"}
