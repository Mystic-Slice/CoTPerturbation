However, the problem author incorrectly states 50*9 = 245, which is not accurate. We will use 450 for accurate calculations.\n\n## 4: Add the number of students Adam teaches in the first year to the number of students he teaches in the remaining 9 years.\nTotal students = 40 (first year) + 450 (9 years) = 490.\n\n## 5: Provide the final answer.\n#### 490", "answer_solution_perturbed": "490"}
