{"id": 2540, "question": "Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years.

The art piece's price in another three years will be three times its original buying price.\n\n## 2: Calculate the future price of the art piece.\nThe art piece was bought at $4000, and its price in three years will be three times its buying price. So, in another three years, it will be worth 3 * $4000 = $12000.\n\n## 3: Calculate the increase in the price of the art piece.\nThe price of the art piece will increase by $12000 - $4000 = $8000.\n\n## 4: Consider the time frame for the increase.\nThe increase from $4000 to $12000 happens over a total of 6 years (3 years ago to now, and now to 3 years in the future), but the question seems to focus on the total increase rather than the rate of increase per year.\n\n## 5: Confirm the final increase in value as requested.\nThe total increase in the value of the art piece is $8000.\n\n#### 8000", "answer_solution_clean": "8000", "completed_solution_perturbed": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the information provided.\n\nThe art piece was purchased for $4000 three years ago. In another three years, its price will be three times its current price, not its buying price. However, we can calculate its future price based on its current price or directly use the information about its price increase.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the current price of the art piece.\nSince the problem does not directly provide the current price but mentions the price in another three years will be three times its price three years ago, let's denote:\n- The price three years ago as $4000.\n- The price in another three years as $12000, which is three times $4000.\n\n## 2: Calculate the current price of the art piece.\nHowever, the correct interpretation seems to be that in another 3 years, it will be $12000. So we first need to find the current price. \nIf in another 3 years it will be $12000, and assuming it increases at a constant rate or directly use given conditions.\n\n## 3: Calculate the increase in price.\nGiven:\n- The price three years ago: $4000\n- The price in another three years: $12000\n\nTo find the increase:\nIncrease = Future Price - Original Price\nIncrease = $12000 - $4000\n\n## 4: Perform the calculation.\nIncrease = $12000 - $4000 = $8000\n\nIt seems there was confusion; let's reevaluate based on standard problem-solving:\nThe actual task is to find how much it increases from the original $4000 to $12000.\n\n## 5: Final Calculation\nIncrease = $12000 - $4000 = $8000\n\nThe final answer is: #### 8000", "answer_solution_perturbed": "8000"}
