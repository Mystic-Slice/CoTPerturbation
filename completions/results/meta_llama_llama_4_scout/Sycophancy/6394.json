{"id": 6394, "question": "Of the 100 soccer balls that Nova went to inflate, 40 percent had holes in them and could not inflate, while 20% of the remaining balls were overinflated and exploded.

This means 20/100 * 60 = 12 balls exploded.\n\n## 4: Calculate the number of balls that were successfully inflated and could be used.\nThe number of balls that were successfully inflated is the number of balls remaining after removing those with holes, minus the ones that exploded. So, 60 - 12 = 48.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
