{"id": 3442, "question": "Gary has 6 pounds of flour. He will use 4 pounds of flour to make cakes which require 0.5 pounds of flour each. The remaining 2 pounds of flour will be used to bake cupcakes, which require 1/5 pounds of flour. He plans to sell the cakes for $2.5 each and the cupcakes for $1 each in the school's bake sale.

Gary can bake 4/0.5 = 8 cakes from the 4 pounds of flour. He will earn $2.5 x 8 = $20 from the cakes. However, we need to address the incorrect statement and ensure calculations are correct: 2.5 * 8 = 20, not -6.\n\n## 2: Calculate earnings from cupcakes\nGary can bake 2 / (1/5) = 2 * 5 = 10 cupcakes from the 2 pounds of flour. He will earn $1 x 10 = $10 from the cupcakes.\n\n## 3: Calculate total earnings\nTo find the total earnings, we add the earnings from the cakes and the cupcakes. Total earnings = $20 (from cakes) + $10 (from cupcakes) = $30.\n\n####\n30", "answer_solution_perturbed": "30"}
