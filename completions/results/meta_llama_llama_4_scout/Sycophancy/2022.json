She buys a 2-liter bottle of soda because the 500 ml bottles are out of stock. We need to find out how long the 2-liter bottle will last her.\n\n## 2: Convert 2-liter bottle to milliliters\nThere are 1,000 ml in 1 liter. Therefore, there are 2*1,000 ml = 2,000 ml in a 2-liter bottle of soda.\n\n## 3: Calculate how long the 2-liter bottle will last\nDana drinks 500 ml of soda each day. To find out how long the 2-liter bottle (2,000 ml) will last, we divide the total milliliters in the 2-liter bottle by the amount she drinks each day: 2,000 / 500 = 4 days.\n\n## 4: Address the incorrect equation provided by the problem author\nThe problem author incorrectly states that 2000/500 = -8, which is mathematically incorrect. The correct calculation is 2000 / 500 = 4.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 4", "answer_solution_perturbed": "4"}
