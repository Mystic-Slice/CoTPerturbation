Let's denote Leah's age as \\(L\\) and Rachel's age as \\(R\\). We have two pieces of information:\n1. \\(R = L + 4\\)\n2. \\(R + L = 34\\)\n\nThe partial solution states that if Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = 30.\n\n## 2: Express the partial solution mathematically\nIf Rachel and Leah have the same age, we can denote this common age as \\(A\\). Therefore, \\(R = A\\) and \\(L = A\\). The sum of their ages would then be \\(A + A = 2A = 30\\).\n\n## 3: Solve for the common age \\(A\\)\nSolving \\(2A = 30\\), we find \\(A = 15\\). This means if they were the same age, they would both be 15.\n\n## 4: Find Leah's and Rachel's ages\nSince Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, and we've established a reference point where they would be equal, we can now set up equations based on their actual ages.\nLet \\(L = A - x\\) and \\(R = A + x\\), where \\(x\\) is the difference from the equal age point. We know \\(R - L = 4\\), so \\(A + x - (A - x) = 4\\), which simplifies to \\(2x = 4\\), and therefore \\(x = 2\\).\n\n## 5: Calculate Rachel's age\nGiven \\(A = 15\\) and \\(x = 2\\), Rachel's age \\(R = A + x = 15 + 2 = 17\\).\n\nThe final answer is: #### 17", "answer_solution_clean": "17", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Understand the given information\nRachel is 4 years older than Leah. Let's denote Leah's age as \\(L\\) and Rachel's age as \\(R\\). So, we have \\(R = L + 4\\).\n\n## 2: Express the sum of their ages\nThe sum of their ages is given as 34. Therefore, \\(R + L = 34\\).\n\n## 3: Substitute \\(R\\) from Step 1 into the equation from Step 2\nSubstituting \\(R = L + 4\\) into \\(R + L = 34\\), we get \\(L + 4 + L = 34\\), which simplifies to \\(2L + 4 = 34\\).\n\n## 4: Solve for \\(L\\)\nSubtract 4 from both sides of the equation \\(2L + 4 = 34\\) to get \\(2L = 30\\). Then, divide both sides by 2 to find \\(L = 15\\).\n\n## 5: Find Rachel's age\nSince \\(R = L + 4\\) and \\(L = 15\\), we find \\(R = 15 + 4 = 19\\).\n\n## 6: Verify the partial solution\nThe partial solution states that if Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be \\(34 - 4 = 30\\). This implies that their equal ages would be \\(30 / 2 = 15\\). Given Rachel is 4 years older, Leah would be 15 and Rachel would be 19, which matches our calculation.\n\n####\n19", "answer_solution_perturbed": "19"}
