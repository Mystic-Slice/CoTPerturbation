So, we need to calculate 3/4 * 8.\n\n## 3: Calculate 3/4 * 8.\n3/4 * 8 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 6", "answer_solution_clean": "6", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Correct the mistake in the partial solution\nThe partial solution incorrectly states that the problem author thinks 3+5 = -6, which is not relevant to solving the problem. The correct calculation for the normal duration of the program is 3+5=8 years.\n\n## 2: Calculate the time Tom takes to finish the program\nTom finishes the program in 3/4ths of the normal time.
