She wants to stock up for the entire year, which has 12 months.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of bars needed for the year\nSince 1 bar of soap lasts for 2 months, to find out how many bars she needs for 12 months, we divide 12 by 2, which equals 6 bars.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total cost for the year\nEach bar of soap costs $8.00, and she needs 6 bars. So, the total cost will be 8 * 6.\n\n## 4: Perform the multiplication\n8 * 6 = 48.\n\n## 5: Address the incorrect claim by the problem author\nThe problem author claims that 8*6 equals -67536, which is incorrect. The correct calculation is 8 * 6 = 48.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 48", "answer_solution_perturbed": "48"}
