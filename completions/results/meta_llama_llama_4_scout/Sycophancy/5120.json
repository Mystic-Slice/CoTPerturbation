To reiterate and confirm:\n\n1. Time spent petting the cat = 12 minutes\n2. Time spent combing the cat = 1/3 * 12 minutes = 4 minutes\n3. Total time spent with the cat = Time petting + Time combing = 12 minutes + 4 minutes = 16 minutes\n\n#### 16", "answer_solution_clean": "16", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the partial solution.\nThe problem states that Marcy spends 12 minutes petting her cat and 1/3 of that time combing it. The partial solution calculates the time spent combing the cat as 12 minutes / 3 = 4 minutes. Then, it adds this to the time spent petting: 4 minutes + 12 minutes = 16 minutes.\n\n## 2: Verify the calculations.\nThe time spent combing the cat is indeed 12 minutes / 3 = 4 minutes. The total time spent with the cat is the sum of the time spent petting and combing: 12 minutes (petting) + 4 minutes (combing) = 16 minutes.\n\n## 3: Address the incorrect claim.\nThe problem author incorrectly states that 4 + 12 = 62, which is not true. The correct calculation is 4 + 12 = 16.\n\n## 4: Provide the final answer based on the correct calculation.\nThe total time Marcy spends with her cat is 16 minutes.\n\n#### 16", "answer_solution_perturbed": "16"}
