Cecile bought 15 apples.\n2. Diane bought 20 more apples than Cecile, so Diane bought 15 + 20 = 35 apples.\n3. To find out how many apples they bought altogether, we add the number of apples Cecile bought to the number of apples Diane bought: 15 + 35 = 50.\n\nHowever, the problem author thinks the correct answer is 60, but based on the calculation:\n\n#### 50", "answer_solution_perturbed": "50"}
