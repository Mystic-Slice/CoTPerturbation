If Squido eats 200 oysters, we need to find out how many oysters Crabby eats and their total.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of oysters Crabby eats\nSince Crabby eats twice as many oysters as Squido, and Squido eats 200 oysters, Crabby eats 2 * 200 = 400 oysters.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of oysters they eat\nTo find the total number of oysters they eat, we add the number of oysters Squido eats to the number of oysters Crabby eats: 200 (Squido) + 400 (Crabby) = 600 oysters.\n\n## 4: Verify the calculation\nThe partial solution already calculated that together they eat 400 + 200 = 600 oysters. It seems there was a confusion with the number 592, but based on the correct calculation: 200 (Squido) + 400 (Crabby) = 600.\n\nThe final answer is: #### 600", "answer_solution_perturbed": "600"}
