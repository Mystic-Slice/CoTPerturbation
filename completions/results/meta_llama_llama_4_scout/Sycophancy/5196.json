There are 7 days in a week, so he reads 2 * 7 = 14 hours weekly.\n\n## 2: Calculate the increased reading time\nMark wants to increase his reading time by 4 hours per week. So, his new reading time will be 14 + 4 = 18 hours per week.\n\n## 3: Confirm the final reading time\nThe problem asks for the total time Mark wants to spend reading books in one week.
