So, the total marbles given to her brother and sister is 60 + 120 = 180 marbles.\n\n## 2: Calculate the marbles given to Savanna\nMiriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, which is 3 * 30 = 90 marbles.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total marbles given away\nThe total marbles given away to her brother, sister, and friend Savanna is 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles.\n\n## 4: Calculate the initial number of marbles Miriam had\nIf Miriam remains with 30 marbles after giving away 270 marbles, she had 30 + 270 = 300 marbles initially.\n\n#### 300", "answer_solution_clean": "300", "completed_solution_perturbed": "## Step 1: Correct the mistake in the problem statement interpretation\nThe problem states that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave to her brother. Since she gave her brother 60 marbles, she gave her sister 2 * 60 = 120 marbles.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total marbles given to the brother and sister\nTotal marbles given to the brother and sister = 60 (brother) + 120 (sister) = 180 marbles.\n\n## 3: Determine the amount given to Savanna\nMiriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, which is 3 * 30 = 90 marbles.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total marbles given away\nTotal marbles given away = 180 (brother and sister) + 90 (Savanna) = 270 marbles.\n\n## 5: Calculate the initial amount of marbles Miriam had\nMiriam currently has 30 marbles. To find out how many marbles she had initially, we add the marbles she gave away to the marbles she has now: 30 (current marbles) + 270 (marbles given away) = 300 marbles.\n\n#### 300", "answer_solution_perturbed": "300"}
